~ Broken Down ~
Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
-
^ use SMART goals to understand objectives of a lesson
^ also look at KA to find more information about subjects

Timeline:
1:30pm - 1:40pm: Warm-Up (conversation + objectives)
1:40pm - 1:55pm: Actual Lesson (include kinesthetic elements)
1:55pm - 2:05pm: Assessment (Kahoot!)
2:05pm - 2:15pm: Discussion + Homework
2:15pm - 2:30pm: Lesson Reflection

Actual Lesson:
Incorporate student interests (get to know them first).
Regarding first actual lesson (or two), just use bright colors and an animal to teach.
After that, I should know them well enough to use what they like personally instead.
Allow interruptions (but focus them back onto the task at hand).

Assessment:
Use Khan Academy exercises for Kahoot! template (of sorts).

Discussion + Homework:
Let them talk amongst themselves (chiming in only if necessary).
Be a friend AND a tutor (there's a really fine line).

Lesson Reflection:
Did anything take longer than expected?
Was there a portion that students asked for a lot of help?
Conversely, did they breeze through with no problem?
Were they engaged and interested?
Did they meet the objectives planned?
Could I present myself better? Be more polite? LISTEN and COMMUNICATE better?
Did I show up on time (meaning 5-10min early)?
Did I use inclusionary language (no slang or acronyms)?
Was student collaboration allowed and encouraged?
Did all students feel accepted and celebrated?
Was I aware of my behavior? Is there anything I could improve on?
