Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will:
-
^ use SMART goals to understand objectives of a lesson
^ also look at KA to find more information about subjects

Timeline:
10 minutes: Warm-up (conversation, introductions, brief overview)
10-15 minutes: Present Google Slides (add kinesthetic elements)
10 minutes: Assessment (Kahoot!)
10 minutes: Thinking + Discussion

Actual Lesson:
Incorporate student interests (get to know them first).
Regarding first lesson (or two), just use bright colors and basic plants/animals.
After that, I should know them well enough to use what they like personally instead.
Allow interruptions (but focus them back onto the task at hand)

Assessment:
Use Khan Academy exercises for Kahoot! template (of sorts).

Discussion:
Let them talk amongst themselves (chiming in only if necessary).
Be a friend AND a tutor (there's a really fine line).

Lesson Reflection:
Did anything take longer than expected?
Was there a portion that students asked for a lot of help?
Conversely, did they breeze through with no problem?
Were they engaged and interested?
Did they meet the objectives planned?
Could I present myself better? Be more polite? LISTEN and COMMUNICATE better?
Did I show up on time (meaning 5-10min early)?
Did I use inclusionary language (no slang or acronyms)?
Was student collaboration allowed and encouraged?
Did all students feel accepted and celebrated?
Was I aware of my behavior? Is there anything I could improve on?
