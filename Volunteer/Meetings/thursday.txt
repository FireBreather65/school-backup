Let them talk amongst themselves (chiming in only if necessary).
Be a friend AND a tutor (there's a really fine line).

Lesson Reflection:
Were they engaged and interested?
Did they meet the objectives planned?
Could I present myself better? Be more polite? LISTEN and COMMUNICATE better?
Did I show up on time (meaning 5-10min early)?
Did I use inclusionary language (no slang or acronyms)?
Was student collaboration allowed and encouraged?
Did all students feel accepted and celebrated?
Was I aware of my behavior? Is there anything I could improve on?
