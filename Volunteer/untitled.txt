~ Traveling Stories ~
- 1 hour/week for 6-9 weeks
- if you're absent more than twice, you'll get kicked out

- we are committed to making reading fun and helping young readers discover the magic of reading
^ so you must be as well haha
- We recommend using online resources. You can use your own book if you have any but prefer something that can be screened shared as it makes it easy to see oppose to showing it via camera.

~ 425Tutoring ~
Once a meeting time is established, create a Google meeting for that time and send them both the link.

Questions for them:
What are [Josiah's or Trishika's] academic interests? What about extracurriculars?
What subjects would you like your students to be tutored in? (verification, especially with Trishika and social <- studies???)
For [subject desired], what has your child already learned? What could they improve on?
How many days a week would you like your child to be tutored in each subject? When (time - exact or estimate) on each of those days?
How much homework do you think is adequate for your student <- for Trishika only, and what's the caveat?
Once school starts, would you like your sessions to be homework help or learning sessions?
Is there anything else I should know about your child? <- for Trishika only, how do I say their name properly?

Answers from me:
- Elaborate on your tutor bio!
- Why do you tutor?

Name: Malycia (Ma-li-cee-a) Ashley
Grade: 10th grade, but preparing to graduate (through getting my GED)
School: Homeschooled
Clubs/Extracurriculars: Computing, Foreign Language
Subjects I Enjoy: MATH, Science (esp. Biochemistry), Language Arts/English, and Humanities (specifically US History)
Why I Tutor: I want to help the world become a better place. I love learning and sharing that knowledge. Some other things blah blah blah.
^ seriously though, I need to find a concrete reason...

Also create a tutor bio to elaborate on during initial meeting...
