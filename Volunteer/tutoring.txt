Tracking Hours:
- open the form (Logging Hours link) after you tutor
- select your name from the dropdown menu
- enter the date, starting, and ending time
- add any additional info (change in schedule, issues, etc.)
- remember that you can log past hours, but not future hours

Notes:
- declare time zone (esp. when scheduling the first meeting)
- receive an email in 1-2 weeks to set up meeting for parents and students
- respond to emails within 24 hours
- you'll be teaching for 8 weeks (then choose to go longer or not)
- tutoring with disabilities requires extra patience (go slow, and ask if they have any questions while going through)
