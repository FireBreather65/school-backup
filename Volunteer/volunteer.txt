4. Leave room for thinking + discussion + comprehension checking (also take breaks to connect with them)
5. Create a positive learning environment (by making everyone feel welcome, believing that no one is "smarter" than another)
6. Use active listening skills (listen to entire question, think and articulate, THEN respond)
