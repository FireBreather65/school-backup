~ Algebra 1 ~

Slope:
- rtl is positive, ltr is negative :)
^ direction determined by higher side

* from two points:
- y2 - y1
~ divided by ~
- x2 - x1

Slope-Intercept Form:
- y = mx + b
^ where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept

Point-Slope Form:
- y - b = m (x - a)
^ b is the y-coordinate of one point
^ m is the slope
^ a is the x-coordinate of the aforementioned point

Standard Form:
- ax + by = c

Linear Equations to Standard Form:
- simplify linear equation (to as basic as possible, removing all fractions)
- set variables (and coefficients, if applicable) to one side, all other numbers on other side
- simplify again (if possible)

Graph to Linear Equation:
- if given y-intercept, use slope-intercept form
- if not, use point-slope form

Systems of Equations w/ Graphing:
- if not already, put equation into slope-intercept form
^ standard form also works, simply find x and y intercepts and ignore last two steps
- set y-intercept as...well...y-intercept XD
- set slope as...well...slope (really, after in slope-int form, it's self-explanatory)

Systems of Equations w/ Elimination:
- add equations together to eliminate a variable
^ or manipulate equations to remove a variable
- solve for that variable
- insert into equation and solve for other variable
- check answer by inserting both variables into other equation

SoEwE in Number of Solutions:
- complete first step of above
^ if we get 0 = 0, there are infinite solutions (consistent)
^ if we get 0 = non-zero, there are no solutions (inconsistent)
^ lastly, if we get something else altogether, there is one solution (the intercept, also consistent)

Graphing Inequalities:
- change line into slope-intercept form (if needed)
- graph line (using what is known about graphing linear equations)
^ if less/greater than or equal to, line is solid - if not, line is dashed
- shade in all space below/above (depending on less or greater than)

Function Rules from Equations:
- function variable will be in equation, solve for other variable
^ e.g. f(x) in terms of x, if variables are x and y, solve equation so y = blah-blah

Domain and Range of Functions:
- x ε ℝ means (x) is a member of real numbers
^ relevant because any real values of x derived from f(x) are in the domain
- round bracket means the number isn't included, square bracket means the number is included
- simply put, domain = x values of the function, range = y values of the function aka f(x)

Functions from Graphs:
- vertical lines aren't functions
^ proved by the vertical line test

Maxima and Minima:
- absolute extremum = the min/max points across the entire function
- relative extremum = the min/max points across specific parts of the function

Inverse Functions:
- solve for other variable (usu. x = f(x) instead of y)
- but still replace y with x in the new equation (WHY?)

Arithmetic vs. Geometric Sequences:
- aritmetic is for addition and subtraction of the common ratio
- geometric is for multiplication and division of the common ratio

Explicit vs. Recursive Functions - Arithmetic:
- explicit definition is typically written in the form f(n) = A - B(n-1)
- whereas recursive definition is typically written in the form below:
~ f(n) = A (if n = 1)
~ f(n) = f(n-1) - B (if n > 1)
- explicit is more helpful for finding a given nth term (simply replace n with term), whereas recursive functions are helpful in computer science...not really obviously helpful in math??

Explicit vs. Recursive Functions - Geometric:
- explicit definition is typically written in the form A * B^(i-1)
- whereas recursive definition is typically written in the form below:
~ A1 = A (if n = 1)
~ Ai = _A^(i-1) (if n > 1 and n ε ℝ)

Absolute Value Functions:
- formula is a|x - h| + k
^ a is the amount the function "stretches" also known as the slope
^ h is the amount away from x (we want that to be 0)
^ k is the y coordinate (relative to the graph)

Piecewise Functions:
- pretty self explanatory haha
- if help is really needed, see this video: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:absolute-value-piecewise-functions/x2f8bb11595b61c86:piecewise-functions/v/evaluating-piecewise-functions-example

Simplifying Square Roots w/ Variables:
- remember, exponents are added, not multiplied, when it comes to squaring as well

Simplifying Square-Root Expressions:
- multiply numbers outside of square roots regularly
- multiply numbers inside of square roots regularly, but take the square root of the product
- then take out perfect squares and etcetera out

Exponential Growth vs. Decay:
- growth comes from numbers greater than 1
- decay comes from numbers smaller than 1 (fractions)
- ...but what happens when it *equals* 1?

Graphing Exponential Functions:
- for example, g(x) = 2 * 3^x
- 2 is the y intercept (verified by the fact that you find the y-int when x = 0, in this case the first coordinate would be [0, 2])
- 3 is the strech (verified when x = 1, in this case the second coordinate would be [1, 6])

Polynomial Intro:
- standard form for expressions means exponents (degrees) are in order from greatest to least
- multiplying binomials w/ an area model is just like multiplying regularly (w/ an area model)
- standard form for polynomial terms is Ax^n
^ where A is the coefficient
^ x is the variable
^ n is the exponent (which must be a non-negative integer)

Special Products of Binomials:
- if in the form (x + a)(x - a), the answer is x² - a²
^ known as difference of squares expressions
- if in the form (x + a)², the answer is x² + 2*a*x + a²
^ known as perfect squares expressions
- if in the form (x - a)², the answer is x² - 2*a*x + a²
^ known as negative perfect squares expressions

Factoring Quadratics Intro:
- standard form for quadratics: x² + (a + b)x + ab <- comes from (x +/- a)(x +/- b)
^ a and b can be figured out using this formula (with the knowledge that the numbers added and multiplied will equal given numbers)
^ for example, x² - x - 42, you can figure out that original equation is (x + 6)(x - 7) knowing standard form
- leading term must always be x², although not all trinomials with that as a leading term can be factored
- quadratics is a fancy term for polynomials with a highest degree of 2

Factoring Quadratics w/ Common Factor:
- sub out common factor, then solve for regular
^ for example, 6x² - 18x - 60 can be solved by subbing out a 6, making it 6(x² - 3x - 10)
^ which can be solved like regular (the answer is 6[x - 5][x + 2])

Factoring Quadratics by Grouping:
- first, group terms that share a GCF (greatest common factor)
^ then factor those terms
- then find common terms amongst the result
^ and factor those haha
- read this if needed: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratics-multiplying-factoring/x2f8bb11595b61c86:factor-quadratics-grouping/a/factoring-by-grouping

Factoring Quadratics w/ Coefficient ≠ 1:
- start by finding two numbers that multiply to ac and add up to b (where a is the first term, b is the second, and c is the third)
- use these numbers to split up the middle x-term
- use grouping (above) to factor the quadratic expression
- again, read this if needed: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratics-multiplying-factoring/x2f8bb11595b61c86:factor-quadratics-grouping/a/factoring-quadratics-leading-coefficient-not-1

Factoring Quadratics w/ Difference of Squares:
- read Special Products of Binomials (above), that's our principle
^ with factoring out the x² coefficient, if possible/needed

Factoring Quadratics w/ Perfect Square Factorization:
- read Special Products of Binomials (above), that's our principle
^ with factoring out the x² coefficient, if possible/needed

Zero Product Property:
- based on the simple idea that if a * b = 0, a or b must be 0
^ you can solve for either side (a or b), there will be two answers though

Solving Quadratics by Taking Square Roots:
- really straightforward once you do it
^ but watch this if you're still confused: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-functions-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:untitled-1082/v/solving-quadratics-by-taking-square-roots

Quadratic Formula:
- x = -b +/- sqrt(b² - 4ac) / 2a
^ memorize this formula (somehow)
^ b² - 4ac is the discriminant
- after in this form, use factoring to simplify

QE in Number of Solutions:
- if b² - 4ac > 0, there are 2 solutions
- if b² - 4ac = 0, there is one solution (0)
- if b² - 4ac < 0, there are no REAL solutions

Graphing Quadratics in Standard Form:
- good to know that standard form is y = ax² + bx + c
- first find the vertex's x-coordinate (-b / 2a)
- next find the vertex's y-coordinate (by inputting the x-coordinate into the original equation)
- to find the y-intercept, set x = 0 (in the original equation and the x-coordinate)
^ PAY ATTENTION TO THE VERTEX VS. RANDOM POINT

Graphing Quadratics in Vertex Form:
- good to know that vertex form is a(x − h)² + k 
- the vertex coordinates are simply (h, k)
- the next pair of coordinates is (h+/-?, y)
^ input +/- h into the equation and solve it, that's your y
^ PAY ATTENTION TO THE VERTEX VS. RANDOM POINT

Graphing Quadratics in Factored Form:
- good to know that factored form is A(x + b)(x + c)
- the x-intercepts are at (b, 0) and (c, 0)
- the vertex's x-coordinate is exactly halfway through the x-intercepts
- the vertex's y-coordinate is found by inputting x-coordinate into original equation
^ PAY ATTENTION TO THE VERTEX VS. RANDOM POINT

Concavity:
- function opens upwards when the coefficent of x² is positive
- function opens downwards when the coefficent of x² is negative

Shifting Parabolas:
- equation from translating: y = (x - h)² + k
- negative values of h are leftward, positive values are rightward
- negative values of k are downward, positive values are upward

Scaling and Reflecting Parabolas:
- scaling by fractions <1 makes parabolas bigger, whereas scaling by whole number makes them smaller
