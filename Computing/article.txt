Notes:
Write a captivating and descriptive headline (something I'd click on).
Use present tense (and active voice) when writing an article.
Break up long paragaphs (articles are less likely to be skimmed that way).
Expand all acronyms on first use (unless it's something that the reader already knows)
Avoid "etc." unless it's obvious/repetitive.
Don't use excessive bold, italics, and especially not both.
Don't refer to colors in figures/pictures.
Check spelling and grammar errors before posting.
Use simple, straightforward language, clean up the punctuation (no ellipses, excessive exclamations, semi-colons).
Aim for 500-1000 words per article.
Always make sure to include clear code examples and explanations so readers can follow.
Attribute quotes (if used) to the people who said them (to avoid claims of plagiarism).
Choose a good cover image (related to what I the article is about).
^ use canva.com to make cover images (to also save from plagiarism claims), using aspect ratio of 1.91:1
Post multi-part tutorials, then longer version, kind of like Disney shorts (where they have individual shorts and the last episode is a compilation).
^ also possibly write sporadic health articles (ways to be a better developer and person kinda thing??)
