You can add a favicon to your website, see this: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp
^ probably don't do it every time, more like for stuff like Mom's Cookbook??

Responsive Text can be made by setting font-size to vw instead of px.

Instead of using <br> to write poems, you can also write the poem and surround it with <pre>, which preserves spaces AND line breaks.

Use <abbr> for abbreviations (pointed out because it's really important for accessibility)

Use th/td:nth-child(odd/even) to create a zebra-striped effect in tables.

Use <kbd> for displaying keyboard shortcuts in a webpage, use <samp> for displaying program output, use <code> for displaying code

For if I ever end up making videos (of me making projects or something??): https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp

Regarding accessibility, remember transcripts for audio and captions for video; clear structure, consistent labeling, predictable links and plain language; have sufficient target sizes; don't make your services "voice-only"; text and images can be enlarged, there's sufficient contrast, not relying on color alone, support text-to-text speech.

When coding, remember to use semantic tags for accessibility. Also, don't default to opening links in a new tab, instead give the user a choice.

Use "aria-label" and "role=____" as attributes if you must use a <div>.

Keep links underlined (as much as possible), to account for grayscale viewers and colorblind folks.

If an image is simply decorative (not essential to the page), set the "alt=____" attribute as empty. Else, set the "alt=____" attribute as a description of the image (or, better yet, the intention of the image).

Use headings correctly and use skip links (to improve accessibility).

If website is changing in language on the screen, change the code along with it (using "lang" or "hreflang")

Also try adding the "magical" autocomplete attribute to forms.

An accessible error message is written in text (colors and an icon can be used, but not alone), close to the element that has failed, informative, and associated to the failed element in the code.
^ the more precise the error's text, the better

Avoid using absolute units with "line-height" (just in case user needs to zoom only text, and the box that holds the text overflows).
