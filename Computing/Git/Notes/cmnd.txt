------ BASH ------

ls - lists all files and directories inside wherever you are

echo - prints text (and other things like equation answers) to the terminal window

cat - reads files, creates files, and/or concatenate files

head - reads the start of a file (10 lines by default)

tail - reads the end of a file (10 lines by default)

less - reads files (without fear of accidentally tampering with them)

pwd - prints working directory (where you are)

cd - changes directory to where you want to go

mkdir - makes a new directory wherever you are

touch - makes a new file wherever you are

clear - clears the terminal from view (doesn't delete past work)

cp - copies files from one place to another

cp -r - copies directories from one place to another

mv - moves and/or renames files and directories (depending on arguments)

rm - removes files

rmdir - removes directories

rm -rf - removes directories without question (XD)

history - lists your most recent commands

alias - creates your own custom Bash commands

[command] --help - brings up a help menu for [command]

------ GIT ------

Über Basic Workflow:

git init - initializes a new git repository

git add (filename) - adds files to staging area for a commit
^ if multiple files separate with spaces, use period if all files are wanted

git commit - adds a commit (use -m and quotation marks to write a commit message)

~

Basic Workflow (extras):

git status - checks status of files in staging area
^ adding --short will show a short log instead of a full log
^ can be untracked, meaning git sees the file but isn't tracking it yet

git diff - checks difference between current status and previously saved status

git log - logs a list of all previous commits

git log (filename) - logs a list of all previous commits for that specific file

~

How to Backtrack:

git show HEAD - shows the most recently made commit

git checkout HEAD (filename) - reverts the file back to its last commit

git reset HEAD (filename) - resets file to HEAD commit and unstages it

git revert [commithash] - reverts the file back to the [commithash] supplied (first 7 of SHA), doesn't erase all commits further

git reset [commithash] - resets the file back to the [commithash] supplied (first 7 of SHA), erases all commits further

git commit --amend - amends a commit (use -m and quotation marks to write new commit message)

~

Git Branching (check out conflict.png for more info):

git branch - lists all branches and lets you know what branch you're on (with green and an asterisk)

git branch (branchname) - creates a new branch

git checkout (branchname) - switches to the branch

git merge (branchname) - merges the branch you're on with the branch that you called

git branch -d (branchname) - deletes the specific branch from your repository

git branch -D (branchname) - same as above, but deletes branches that were never merged with main

git clone (remote_location) (clone_name) - clones an existing repository so you can edit w/o immediately committing changes to said repository (on a branch called origin)

git fetch - fetches changes that others have made to your clone (on a remote branch, not the main), and doesn't merge them

git merge origin/main - merges the origin (your) branch with the main (main) branch

git push origin (branchname) - pushes an existing branch to the origin (your) branch

git pull origin (branchname) - pulls the remote version of a repository to the origin (your) branch
