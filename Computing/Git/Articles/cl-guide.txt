- Helpful Git Commands
	- How do you get help for a specific command?
	You can use the command git [command name here] help.

	- How do you see all commands?
	You can use git help --all.

	- How do you look at the history of your previous commits?
	First, make sure you're in a directory that's being tracked by Git. After that, all you have to do is type git log.

	To find the history of your previous commits for a specific file, just add the filename to the end of the command (give an example).

	- How do you copy a repository onto your local machine from GitHub?
	https://www.janbasktraining.com/community/devops/what-is-the-difference-between-pull-and-clone-in-git <- figure this out
	https://www.delftstack.com/howto/git/difference-of-git-clone-and-git-pull/ <- this can be helpful...

	- What are some other commands to note?
	There's git diff, which checks difference between current status and previously saved status (explain a bit better??).

Summary
	[recap on helpful terms learned and what we now know, in less of a childish sounding way], also take note that I didn't cover Git Teamwork (explain that I don't have much experience).
	^ Also potentially make a future tutorial for Advanced Git (at a milestone or something, at least after I learn AND use these things???)

Important Links/References:
- https://blog.greenroots.info/20-useful-markdown-syntaxes-for-developers <- for marking down my article during the second draft
- also during the second draft, find consistent way to present folder vs. directory, tree vs. structure, and folder tree vs. directory structure 🤣🤣🤣
^ another consistency issue with tutorial vs. article...I was not cut out for this lmao
^ yet another consistency issue with git revert then git reset...
^ ANOTHER CONSISTENCY ISSUE WITH MAKING SURE WE'RE IN A GIT-TRACKED REPO FIRST
^ yet. another. consistency. issue. (this time with you vs. we/us)
- also during the second draft, add more interactive elements (to reinforce what I'm teaching)
^ add text to a couple files (to supplement later merge conflict 😊)
- divide articles (as already done), and work on INDIVIDUALLY <- easier and less overwhelming...

- w3schools git link?
- codecademy git link?
- education.github.com???

~ Wait until next year to post this, then release one part at a time (Navigating, Changing, etc.) ~
^ add the following reminders at the beginning of each part:
	- laptop or desktop before starting
	- for windows users (link to linux/mac users)
	- git teamwork (for appropriate tutorials)
	- to read the articles in order (at least the first one, where Git Bash is downloaded) <- emphasize importance of reading in order due to difficulty increasing
^ name entire compilation "The Foodie's Guide to Git Bash"
^ same cover image for all (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Git_session.svg/1200px-Git_session.svg.png) <= maybe find a food image instead??
