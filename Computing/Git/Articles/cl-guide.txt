More Advanced Git Bash
  - Backtracking with Git
    - How do you show the most recently made commit?
    Use git show HEAD to show the most recently made commit.

    - How do you revert a file back to its last commit?
    Use git checkout HEAD [filename] to revert [filename] back to its last commit.

    - How do you reset a file to its HEAD commit?
    Use git reset HEAD [filename] to reset [filename] to its HEAD commit (also removes it from the staging area)

    - What's the difference between git revert and git reset? Also, how do you use both of them?
      ^ Use git reset to delete previous commits (from where you are - where you're going), whereas git revert keeps previous commits
      ^ use git reset [commithash] (using the log --oneline)
      ^ https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_reset.asp
      ^ use git revert [commithash] (using the log --oneline)
      ^ https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_revert.asp
      ^ change into similar to above

	- Git Branching
		- How do you list all branches?
    You can use git branch to list all branches (lets you know what branch you are on with green and an asterisk)

    - How do you create a branch?
    You can use git branch [branchname] to create a branch.

    - How do you switch branches?
    You can use git checkout [branchname] to switch branches.

    - How can you merge branches?
    You can use git merge [branchname] to merge branches (will merge called branch with current branch, so make sure you're on the right branch before you call this one...)

    - How can you delete branches?
    There are two ways - using git branch -d [branchname] and git branch -D [branchname]. Use the first if the branch is merged with main, and use the second for branches never merged with main.



		- Explain git push origin main.
		Well, let's break it down:
			- git push is what we use to push local branches to Github
			- origin is the name of our remote connection (elaborate)
			- and main is the name of our default local branch
		
		- How do you push a branch not named main to Github?
		It's as simple as changing the word "main" to the name of your branch (e.g. turtle, pecan)

	- Helpful Git Commands
		- How do you get help for a specific command?
		You can use the command git [command name here] help.

		- How do you see all commands?
		You can use git help --all.

		- How do you look at the history of your previous commits?
		First, make sure you're in a directory that's being tracked by Git. After that, all you have to do is type git log.

    - What are some other commands to note?
    ^ bring up cmnd.txt y'all
    ^ also write about git diff (never used it)
    
    - How do you copy a repository onto your local machine from GitHub?
    ^ with git clone
    ^ also note that git commands introduced will only work with a folder being tracked with Git

Summary: [recap on helpful terms learned and what we now know, in less of a childish sounding way], also take note that I didn't cover Git Teamwork (explain that I don't have much experience)
^ Also potentially make a future tutorial for Advanced Git (at a milestone or something, at least after I learn AND use these things haha???)
