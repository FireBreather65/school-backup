- Git Branching
	- How do you list all branches?
  You can use git branch to list all branches (lets you know what branch you are on with green and an asterisk)

	- How do you create a branch?
  You can use git branch [branchname] to create a branch.

	- How do you switch branches?
  You can use git checkout [branchname] to switch branches.

	- How can you merge branches?
  You can use git merge [branchname] to merge branches (will merge called branch with current branch, so make sure you're on the right branch before you call this one...)

	- How do you resolve merge conflicts?
  You can resolve merge conflicts by viewing the marked-up file (that will tell you where the discrepancies lie).
	^ look through and articulate conflict.png (will help a lot)

	- How can you delete branches?
  There are two ways - using git branch -d [branchname] and git branch -D [branchname]. 
		
	Use the first if the branch is merged with main, and use the second for branches never merged with main.

	- Explain git push origin main.
	Well, let's break it down:
		- git push is what we use to push local branches to Github

		- origin is the name of our remote connection (elaborate)

		- and main is the name of our default local branch

	- How do you push a branch not named main to Github?
	It's as simple as changing the word "main" to the name of your branch (e.g. turtle, pecan)

	- Helpful Git Commands
		- How do you get help for a specific command?
		You can use the command git [command name here] help.

		- How do you see all commands?
		You can use git help --all.

		- How do you look at the history of your previous commits?
		First, make sure you're in a directory that's being tracked by Git. After that, all you have to do is type git log.

		To find the history of your previous commits for a specific file, just add the filename to the end of the command (give an example).

		- How do you copy a repository onto your local machine from GitHub?
		https://www.janbasktraining.com/community/devops/what-is-the-difference-between-pull-and-clone-in-git <- figure this out
		https://www.delftstack.com/howto/git/difference-of-git-clone-and-git-pull/ <- this can be helpful...

		- What are some other commands to note?
		There's git diff, which checks difference between current status and previously saved status (explain a bit better??).
		^ as of right now, that's all I have (I'M SO PROUD THOUGH HAHA)

Summary
	[recap on helpful terms learned and what we now know, in less of a childish sounding way], also take note that I didn't cover Git Teamwork (explain that I don't have much experience).
	^ Also potentially make a future tutorial for Advanced Git (at a milestone or something, at least after I learn AND use these things???)

- https://blog.greenroots.info/20-useful-markdown-syntaxes-for-developers <- for marking down my article during the second draft
- also during the second draft, find consistent way to present folder vs. directory, tree vs. structure, and folder tree vs. directory structure 🤣🤣🤣
^ another consistency issue with tutorial vs. article...I was not cut out for this lmao
^ yet another consistency issue with git revert then git reset...

- w3schools git link?
- codecademy git link?
