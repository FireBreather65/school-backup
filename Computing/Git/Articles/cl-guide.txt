More Advanced Git Bash
	- Backtracking with Git
		- How do you show the most recently made commit?
    Use git show HEAD to show the most recently made commit.

		- How do you revert a file back to its HEAD commit?
    Use git checkout HEAD [filename] to revert [filename] back to its last commit.

		- How do you reset a file to its HEAD commit?
    Use git reset HEAD [filename] to reset [filename] to its HEAD commit (also removes it from the staging area)
		^ add reasons why you'd want to unstage files

		- How do you revert a file to a specific commit?
		Use git revert [commithash] to revert the file to the supplied [commithash].

		- How do you reset a file to a specific commit?
		Use git reset [commithash] to reset the file to the supplied [commithash].

		- What's the difference between git revert and git reset?
		The difference is between git revert and git reset is that git revert (both versions) doesn't erase your commits further, whereas git reset (both versions) does.
		^ be sure to include (--oneline) option (so they don't get stuck reading long lines of commits and stuff)

		- How do you amend a previously made commit?
		Use git commit --amend to amend a file's commit message (should only be used on local repositories)
		^ https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_amend.asp
		^ https://devconnected.com/how-to-amend-git-commit-message/

	- Git Branching
		- How do you list all branches?
    You can use git branch to list all branches (lets you know what branch you are on with green and an asterisk)

		- How do you create a branch?
    You can use git branch [branchname] to create a branch.

		- How do you switch branches?
    You can use git checkout [branchname] to switch branches.

		- How can you merge branches?
    You can use git merge [branchname] to merge branches (will merge called branch with current branch, so make sure you're on the right branch before you call this one...)

		- How do you resolve merge conflicts?
    You can resolve merge conflicts by viewing the marked-up file (that will tell you where the discrepancies lie).
		^ look through and articulate conflict.png (will help a lot)

		- How can you delete branches?
    There are two ways - using git branch -d [branchname] and git branch -D [branchname]. 
		
		Use the first if the branch is merged with main, and use the second for branches never merged with main.

		- Explain git push origin main.
		Well, let's break it down:
			- git push is what we use to push local branches to Github

			- origin is the name of our remote connection (elaborate)

			- and main is the name of our default local branch

		- How do you push a branch not named main to Github?
		It's as simple as changing the word "main" to the name of your branch (e.g. turtle, pecan)

	- Helpful Git Commands
		- How do you get help for a specific command?
		You can use the command git [command name here] help.

		- How do you see all commands?
		You can use git help --all.

		- How do you look at the history of your previous commits?
		First, make sure you're in a directory that's being tracked by Git. After that, all you have to do is type git log.

		To find the history of your previous commits for a specific file, just add the filename to the end of the command (give an example).

		- How do you copy a repository onto your local machine from GitHub?
		https://www.janbasktraining.com/community/devops/what-is-the-difference-between-pull-and-clone-in-git <- figure this out
		https://www.delftstack.com/howto/git/difference-of-git-clone-and-git-pull/ <- this can be helpful...

		- What are some other commands to note?
		There's git diff, which checks difference between current status and previously saved status (explain a bit better??).
		^ as of right now, that's all I have (I'M SO PROUD THOUGH HAHA)

Summary
	[recap on helpful terms learned and what we now know, in less of a childish sounding way], also take note that I didn't cover Git Teamwork (explain that I don't have much experience).
	^ Also potentially make a future tutorial for Advanced Git (at a milestone or something, at least after I learn AND use these things???)

- also during the second draft, find consistent way to present folder vs. directory, tree vs. structure, and folder tree vs. directory structure 🤣🤣🤣
^ another consistency issue with tutorial vs. article...I was not cut out for this lmao
