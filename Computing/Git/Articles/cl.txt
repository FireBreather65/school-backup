Introduction: Git Bash is a popular *version control system (VCS)*, meaning it's a software designed to record changes within one or more files over time. It also allows us to undo - or even cancel - the made or pending changes in one or more files.

You might be wondering, what does this mean? Why does this matter to me?

Well, by using a VCS ([in this case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software), Git Bash), you can track your projects.

Say you were working on a webpage, and you deleted the main contents of the page. You would then lose the main file in your project, as well as hours of work.

But, if you used Git Bash to track these files and changes made to said files, you could revert the changes (more on that later).
