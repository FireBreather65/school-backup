Double Diamond Process:
- discover (divergent strategy): explore the problem and landscape, and learn from users and the market through user interviews, surveys, and other research
- define (convergent strategy): sort and analyze the information gathered during the discovery stage and hone in on the problem we’re trying to solve
- develop (divergent execution): generate a range of ideas for possible solutions through brainstorms, workshops, low fidelity prototypes, and other ideation methods
- deliver (convergent execution): hone in on, develop, and deliver the solution
^ continue evaluating and testing the developed design to ensure it meets user needs

PDLC Process:
- brainstorm: starting from a defined problem or pain point, the team brainstorms all possible solutions
- define: the team aligns on specifications for the product by defining the vision, goals, target users, features, benefits, and success metrics
- design: the product is designed from low-fidelity to high-fidelity, starting with sketches and wireframes and moving to prototypes and a completed interface
- test: the product or prototype is tested to ensure it works as intended
- launch: the final design is released to the public
^ testing continues even after launch though

Design Thinking Process:
- empathize: understand the user and the landscape
- define: define the problem and align with business goals and user needs
- ideate: generate a range of ideas for possible solutions, emphasizing creativity
- prototype: explore potential solutions by creating prototypes of the product to gather feedback
- test: test the best solutions developed during prototyping
^ may result in redefining the original problem

UCD Process:
- understand: empathize with the user
- specify: hone in on a specific problem to solve
- design: brainstorm and develop solutions
- evaluate: test the product or prototypes to assess success and incorporate feedback

"Good" UX is:
- useful aka fulfills a user's needs
- useable aka easy to use and understand
- desirable aka visually attractive and succinct
- findable aka easy to navigate and find information
- accessible aka users with disabilities can use the product
- credible aka the product, company, and services are trustworthy
- valuable aka delivers business value

10 Usability Heuristics:
- visibility of system status (like if it's slow/broken/etc.)
- match between system and real world (esp. with icons)
- user control and freedom (not static)
- consistency and standards (similar to #2, but within the system as well)
- error prevention
- recognition rather than recall
^ like asking "Is Havana the capital of Cuba?" vs. "What's the capital of Cuba?"
- flexibility and efficiency of use (for experienced users vs. novice users)
- aesthetic and minimalist design (all for it haha)
- help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors (simple error messages vs. error codes)
- help and documentation
