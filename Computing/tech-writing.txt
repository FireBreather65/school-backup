Read others' technical articles, to get a feel for how to write them.

Develop a unique voice (don't try to copy others)

Include a link to new or unfamiliar terms (better yet, define it yourself)

Use terms consistently (if a term is too long/wordy, give it a nickname AT THE BEGINNING, not halfway through)

"On the initial use of an unfamiliar acronym within a document or a section, spell out the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses. Put both the spelled-out version and the acronym in boldface."
^ don't swap between the acronym and full version in the same document, stick with one or the other
^ also don't define acronyms that will be used less than 5 times in your article

Avoid using ambiguous pronouns (also pronouns overall)

Use second person ("you" rather than "we")

Use the right terms (don't be afraid to use a dictionary)

Avoid "etc." unless it's obvious/repetitive.

Use active voice instead of passive voice (sentences are more to the point that way)
^ to know which one you're using, remember that active voice = actor + verb + target, whereas passive voice = target + verb + actor

Choose strong (aka more descriptive) verbs, avoid:
  - forms of be (like is/are or was/were)
	^ + past participle verbs
	- occur
	- happen

Use the below table as a point of reference:
- fully passive voice: Code is interpreted by Python, but code is compiled by C++.
- semi passive voice: Python interprets code, but code is compiled by C++.
- fully active voice: Python interprets code, but C++ compiles code.

Minimize certain adjectives and adverbs (be more literal, while still being interesting)

Focus each sentence on a single idea (make them shorter, making them easier to read)
^ convert some long sentences into lists instead of individual sentences

DON'T USE FILLER TEXT (LITERALLY STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE)

Don't refer to colors in figures/pictures (for blind folks and for monochrome printers)

Don't use excessive bold, italics, and especially not both.

Use simple, straightforward language, clean up the punctuation (no ellipses, excessive exclamations, semi-colons).

Aim for 500-1000 words per article (unless it's a handbook)

Keep the one sentence = one idea formula in mind

If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use which. If you don't hear a pause, use that.

There are three types of lists (bulleted, numbered, and run-in).
^ bulleted are for random ideas, numbered are for steps in order, and run-in are to be avoided XD)

Start numbered lists with commanding verbs

Create useful tables/images/code snippets, basically more than just words haha
^ it can help to write the caption before creating an image
^ make sure your caption is brief, memorable, and focused

Following above, if specifying a part of an image (for readers to click on or simply focus on), use a marking like a shape or color

Also following above - when using code snippets - use samples that are correct, concise, and can be reused with minimal side effects
^ also use comments (explaining why - not what - the code is doing what it's doing, unless it's obvious)

Ask questions like:
- "Who is my audience?"
- "Why are they reading my article?"
- "What are they expecting?"

Paragraph "Rubric":
- What are you trying to tell your reader?
- Why is it important for the reader to know this?
- How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?

Use widely known metaphors/similes/idioms (if any), that won't confuse or alienate any readers.

Be sure to organize the document (before writing) to meet your audience's needs (like so, replacing algorithm and interpreting my own order):
- Overview of the algorithm
  - Compare and contrast with quicksort, including Big O comparisons
    - Link to Wikipedia article on quicksort
  - Optimal datasets for the algorithm
- Implementing the algorithm
  - Implementation in pseudocode
  - Implementation tips, including common mistakes
- Deeper analysis of algorithm
  - Edge cases
  - Known unknowns

Find peer editors (and coders), because work is best done with others.
^ where to find these, though??

Do good research, like the following:
- "How can I use [technology]"
or ask a peer (above) politely, like so:
- "Hi [name], my name is [name]. I know you are very knowledgeable about using [technology]. I have seen some of your work over the years and it looks amazing. I'd love to know how I can [specific technological goals]? I'd totally understand if you can't respond because of your busy schedule but I will be glad if you do."
^ but update to use own words
or even get a book from the library

"How-to guides, introductory overviews, and conceptual guides often work better as shorter documents when aimed at readers who are new to the subject matter."

"In-depth tutorials, best practice guides, and command-line reference pages can work well as lengthier documents, especially when aimed at readers who already have some experience with the tools and subject matter."

"After writing your first draft, read your content out loud while assuming you are the reader. This will help you spot things that can be rephrased."

Use https://hemingwayapp.com/ to help with writing (after first and second drafts are completed).

Make an article on my frequent Google or StackOverflow searches (with answers).
^ but not just me personally, something I think others have experienced as well

Post multi-part tutorials, then longer version, kind of like Disney shorts (where they have individual shorts and the last episode is a compilation).
^ also possibly write sporadic health articles (ways to be a better developer and person kinda thing??)

Maybe also post articles on dev.to and linkedin??

If I end up making videos, use https://obsproject.com/download to help me.

Potentially have a newsletter on my personal website or blog(s)???
