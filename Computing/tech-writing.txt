Define new or unfamiliar terms (give a link, if they can explain it better).

Be sure to use terms consistently (if a term is too long/wordy, give it a nickname AT THE BEGINNING, not halfway through).

"On the initial use of an unfamiliar acronym within a document or a section, spell out the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses. Put both the spelled-out version and the acronym in boldface."

Don't go back and forth with the acronym and expanded version, stick to one (if sticking to expanded version, why even introduce the acronym??)

Also don't define acronyms that will only be used a few times. Only define ones where either the acronym is much shorter than the full term, and/or it appears many times in the article.

Avoid using pronouns (especially ambiguously).

Use active voice vs. passive voice (because the sentences tend to be shorter and more to the point, unlike this one).
^ to know which one you're using, remember that active voice = actor + verb + target, whereas passive voice = target + verb + actor

Choose strong verbs (unlike forms of be, occur, happen)
^ aka more descriptive verbs haha

Reduce there is/are, in order to keep active voice.
^ but don't replace with weak verbs

Minimize certain adjectives and adverbs (be more literal, while still being interesting)

Focus each sentence on a single idea (make them shorter, making them easier to read)
^ convert some long sentences into lists vs. individual sentences

DON'T USE FILLER TEXT (LITERALLY STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM IT AS POSSIBLE)

Keep the one sentence = one idea formula in mind.

If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use which. If you don't hear a pause, use that.

There are three types of lists (bulleted, numbered, and run-in).
^ bulleted are for random ideas, numbered are for steps in order, and run-in are to be avoided (XD)

Start numbered lists with imperative (commanding) verbs.

Create useful tables and images, basically more than just words haha

Paragraph "Rubric":
- What are you trying to tell your reader?
- Why is it important for the reader to know this?
- How should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?

Use widely known metaphors/similes/idioms (if any), that won't confuse or alienate any readers.

Be sure to organize the document to meet your audience's needs (like so, replacing algorithm and interpreting my own order):
- Overview of the algorithm
  - Compare and contrast with quicksort, including Big O comparisons
    - Link to Wikipedia article on quicksort
  - Optimal datasets for the algorithm
- Implementing the algorithm
  - Implementation in pseudocode
  - Implementation tips, including common mistakes
- Deeper analysis of algorithm
  - Edge cases
  - Known unknowns
