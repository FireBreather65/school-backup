Wireframing:
- do good research by Googling "how can i use [technology]", asking a peer politely, or even getting a book about it ✔
- pay attention to who my audience is, why they would read my article, and what they're expecting when wireframing layout ✔
- wireframe similar to a website, basic guide on the article and my ideas for it ✔
- use "Article Organization" to help wireframe ✔

First Draft:
- use a unique voice (don't try to copy others) ✔
- include a link to new or unfamiliar terms (better yet, define it yourself) 
- on the initial use of an unfamiliar acronym within a document or a section, spell out the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses.
^ put both the spelled-out version and the acronym in boldface
- avoid "etc." unless it's obvious/repetitive
- focus each sentence into a single idea (keep one sentence = one idea formula in mind)
^ convert some long sentences into lists instead of individual sentences
- refrain from referring to colors in images (for blind folks and monochromatic printers)
- also refrain from using bold, italics, and especially don't use both
- start numbered lists with commanding (action) verbs
- use widely known metaphors/similes/idioms (to avoid confusing/alienating readers)
- read article aloud (assuming I'm the reader), helps you spot things that could be rephrased

Feedback and Editing:
- make sure the right terms were used (don't be afraid to use a dictionary)
- check for consistent and correct use of terms (if a term is too long/wordy, give it a nickname AT THE BEGINNING, not halfway through)
- check for ambiguous pronouns (replace if used)
- make sure correct person was used (second person, using "you" instead of "we")
- check for correct usage of voice (active instead of passive, use table in "Notes" below)
^ remember that active voice = actor + verb + target, whereas passive voice = target + verb + actor
- check for strong verb choice, avoid forms of be (like is/are or was/were), occur, and happen
- minimize certain adjectives and adverbs (to be more literal)
- check for filler text (remove IMMEDIATELY)
- clean up the punctuation (no ellipses, excessive exclamations, semi-colons)
- check list usage (bulleted vs. numbered vs. run-in, avoid that last one)
- verify use of that vs. which (if there's a pause before the subordinate clause, use which, otherwise use that)
- using "Paragraph Rubric" (under "Notes), revise and edit paragraphs to fit this

Second Draft:
- aim for 500 words or more per article (unless it's a handbook, then it should be 15000 or more)
- create useful code snippets, tables, and images so it's not just words
^ it can help to write the caption before creating an image
^ make sure your caption is brief, memorable, and focused
- following above, if specifying a part of an image (for readers to focus on), use a marking like a shape or color
- also following above, when using code snippets - use samples that are correct, concise, and can be reused with minimal side effects
^ also use comments (explaining why - not what - the code is doing what it's doing, unless it's obvious)
- read article aloud (assuming I'm the reader), helps you spot things that could be rephrased
^ also use https://hemingwayapp.com/ to help

Publishing (Mon-Thurs):
- post articles on hashnode, linkedin, and dev.to
- post multi-part tutorials, then longer compilation, like Disney shorts (where they have individual shorts and the last episode is a compilation).
^ also possibly write sporadic health articles (ways to be a better developer and person kinda thing??)
^ also possibly write an article on my frequent Google and/or StackOverflow searches (with answers), ones that would help most people
