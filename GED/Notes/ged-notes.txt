- possibly take them all on the same day??
^ not sure, maybe divide as 2 tests over 2 days
^ but probably in real life (less expensive)

- get enough sleep (obvious, but important), eat a good breakfast (omelet, small one), take deep breaths, and be on time

- correct identification, registration confirmation, wear comfortable clothing (don't worry about looks), a bottle of water + snack

- make sure the screen is at a comfortable height, use the bathroom before you start

- pay attention to what I'm being asked, use the process of elimination, don't overthink, find the best answer (and double check)

- take time to relax, make sure you know the rules of the room, keep your eyes on the monitor, stay calm

- take week before test (birthday week) to rest and relax (only study a bit, mostly practice tests)

- leave a little early on test day (earlier is better than later, because you could lose your spot)

- have everything prepared night before (id, clothes, directions, calculator, nutritious snack)

- start with the easy questions (flag not easy ones to come back to later)
