^ focus on science vocabulary (back of dictionary, and online)

- mathematical reasoning test: algebra, hs statistics, geometry and measurement

- possibly take them all on the same day??

- become familiar with a calculator reference sheet

- answer all questions (even if not sure) because there isn't a penalty for guessing

- read editorials and newspaper stories (analyze two sides and recognize how they make their points with evidence)

- time doesn't brought over, you have a set time for all parts (so make the most of it)

- make sure the screen is at a comfortable height, use the bathroom before you start

- pay attention to what I'm being asked, use the process of elimination, don't overthink, find the best answer (and double check)

- take time to relax, make sure you know the rules of the room, keep your eyes on the monitor, stay calm
