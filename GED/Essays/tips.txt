- make a list of information that may go into your essay to back up your argument

- trim out any information that doesn't pertain to the topic

- start with a good, strong introductory sentence that will catch the reader's attention

- follow the introductory sentence with a couple sentences outlining the key points

- turn each key point into a paragraph, paying attention to the flow

- write a conclusion by restating your evidence briefly but memorably

- re-read essay to check flow and sense, fix if needed (and if there's time)

- use a variety of sentences (quotes, statements, questions, exclamations)

- make people interested in my writing (somehow...)

- remember that comparing/contrasting is important, not just stating and going off of who's was better

- GED essay is graded on creation of argument and use of evidence (from the passage), development and organizational structure, clarity and command of standard English conventions

Paragraph Writing:
-	Main Idea (Topic sentence): states the main idea of the entire paragraph. This allows readers to understand what all the subpoints that follow are working to support.
-	Evidence: this is the information (examples, quotes, paraphrase) that are used to support and explain the claim made in the topic sentence.
-	Analysis: Analyze the evidence in your own words. Explain to readers what it means and why it is significant so they are sure to get the meaning you intend from the evidence.
-	Link: Restate the main idea of the paragraph as is presented in the topic sentence. The other option to create a paragraph transition by adding to the link the main idea that will be presented in the next paragraph with a paragraph transition. This helps to ease the essay’s flow and show how all the ideas are connected. 

Starting Sentence Ideas:
- add background information is to locate an unusual and/or interesting fact about one of the two items being compared
- present a little known fact or an interesting position about what is being compared and contrasted
^ Because the compare and contrast essay analyzes and evaluates the similarities and differences between two topics, the introduction needs to offer readers background on both. To do this successfully, create a general discussion of information you think readers may need to understand and care about the topics.
