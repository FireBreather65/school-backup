When you think about age milestones* throughout your life, a few things may come to mind - being allowed to drive when you're 16, being allowed to drink when you're 21, and being allowed to run for president when you're 35. You may also think about voting - when you're 18. But what if you were allowed to vote when you were 16 instead of 18? There are pros to younger voters, such as higher voter turnout and potential lifelong voting habits. However, there are cons such as lack of maturity and an inability to make good decisions.

16-year-olds are just as knowledgeable about civics and can make as good of voting choices as their 18-year-old counterparts. The "cold cognition” skills needed to make informed, well-thought out choices in voting are present in 16-year-olds.

Lowering the voting age to 16 increases voter turnout and develops lifelong voting habits. Although the 18-29 age group has extremely low voter turnout numbers, consider this: 18-year-olds are in a period of transition (being labelled as an adult, heading off to college, and starting to live on their own, among other things). They tend to be so overwhelmed that they neglect to vote. By setting the voting age at a time where teens are less swamped, they're more likely to participate in the future because of habit.

Finally, at 16, people are old enough to be affected by laws - so why shouldn't they be allowed to vote on the very things that are going to affect them? Most 16-year-olds have the mental capacity and the time to vote, so why not let them? This is why I believe that the voting age should be lowered to 16.

Part 1 – Organization 
Organizationally, when highlighting topic sentences within body paragraphs, please strive to make sure that within each one, you both, include an element of your main idea and also clearly outline what each body paragraph will be centered on from the outset. 

For instance, instead of posing a question in relation to laws and voting age within your last paragraph, how might you include a statement that better articulates your take on the issue and also best embodies what your paragraph will be focused on? 


Part 2 – Development 
Development wise, your thesis could use a bit of work at the moment. More specifically, this is true in relation to including more specific and clear supporting details. This way, you provide your readers with a more clear roadmap in light of what you plan on conveying to them over the rest of your essay. 

For instance, why might making the voting age younger result in a lifelong committed voter to the democratic process?  

Also, when unpacking your major claims with minor claims of support, please strive to avoid generalizing and instead, include clear and specific examples throughout. This way, you paint a more clear image in light of the picture that you are attempting to depict to your readers. 

For instance, why might a sixteen year old not be mature enough to vote for someone? Can you highlight a hypothetical example that best depicts why that might not be a good idea? 


Part 3 – Formatting and Style
Style wise, when highlighting your target audience, please strive to use a more objective tone that better reflects your target readers throughout. 

i.e. if my audience is universal, when referring to them, I would use terms like people, individuals or one, instead of terms like you, we or us. 

Who is your target audience in this instance? What term or terms might you use when referring to them?

Also, in relation to word choice, please strive to avoid using vague abstractions such as terms like “things” throughout and instead, strive to use more specific and precise language that better reflects what you are attempting to convey to your readers at the sentence level. 

Also, since this is a formal piece of writing, please strive to avoid using contractions throughout and instead, strive to spell out each term. i.e. instead of saying can’t or won’t, you should either say cannot or will not.
