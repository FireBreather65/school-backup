According to Merriam-Webster, zoos are a facility with usually indoor and outdoor settings where living, typically wild animals are kept especially for public exhibition. There are quite a few pros to them, such as they educate the public on conservation efforts, teach people about animals, and save species from extinction by breeding. But there are also cons to them, like the fact that they're detrimental to the animals' physical and mental health.

Educating the public on conservation efforts is critical to getting people to care - if they don't know there's a problem, how are they supposed to fix it? Zoos teach people - especially children - about animals and the changes that can be made to help conserve them. But they don't teach enough to justify keeping animals in captivity - there are plenty of nature shows and documentaries that can show and tell the same thing while letting animals be in their natural habitat.

Zoos also save species from extinction by breeding, and they've "brought back" many animals thus far, such as snapping turtles, golden lion tamarins, and Panamanian golden frogs, among many others. They're also currently working to save many different animals from a variety of situations, such as habitat loss, poachers, hunters, and population declines (among bees and butterflies). 

But, conversely, they are very damaging to the animals' mental and physical health. As the enclosures are too small for them to carry out their natural routines, problems develop such as pacing and more infant deaths. Animals such as elephants spend about 83% of their time indoors instead of outside, contributing to weight problems and early death. As for being psychologically damaging, animal behaviorists have observed some animals suffering from mental issues not found amongst their wild counterparts, such as clinical depression, OCD, and anxiety.

My opinion, based on the facts, is that zoos aren't necessary - they do have pros such as education about conservation efforts and saving species from extinction, but compromising the animals' mental and physical health isn't worth it. Possibly if they were changed to only help with breeding and release back into the wild, it would be better. But as it stands, I believe zoos need work.
