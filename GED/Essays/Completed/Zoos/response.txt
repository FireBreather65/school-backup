[Check indentations at the beginning of a paragraph. Review this throughout paper.] According to Merriam-Webster, zoos are a facility with usually indoor and outdoor settings where living, typically wild animals are kept especially for public exhibition. There are quite a few pros to them, such as they educate the public on conservation efforts, teach people about animals, and save species from extinction by breeding. But [Review word choice. (Ex. However)] there are also cons to them, like the fact that they're detrimental to the animals' physical and mental health. [Your thesis contains an argument with a topic, position, and reason why. Have you considered creating a more concise and direct argument? (Ex. Due to _____________________, there are both pros and cons for animals in zoos.)]

Educating the public on conservation efforts is critical to getting [Review word form. (Ex. get)] people to care - if they don't know there's a problem, how are they supposed to fix it? Zoos teach people - especially children - about animals and the changes that can be made to help conserve them. But [Review word choice. (Ex. still)] they don't teach enough to justify keeping animals in captivity - there are plenty of nature shows and documentaries that can show and tell the same thing while letting animals be in their natural habitat. [Why is it important for animals to be in their natural habitat? How does it impact their health and well-being?]

Zoos also save species from extinction by breeding, and they've "brought back" many animals thus far, such as snapping turtles, golden lion tamarins, and Panamanian golden frogs, among many others. They're also currently working to save many different animals from a variety of situations, such as habitat loss, poachers, hunters, and population declines (among bees and butterflies). [What actions do zoos take to save animals from various dire situations? Why are these actions important?]

But, [Omit unnecessary words (Ex. But)] conversely, they are very damaging to the animals' mental and physical health. As the enclosures are too small for them to carry out their natural routines, problems develop such as pacing and more infant deaths. Animals such as elephants spend about 83% of their time indoors instead of outside, contributing to weight problems and early death. As for being psychologically damaging, animal behaviorists have observed some animals suffering from mental issues not found amongst their wild counterparts, such as clinical depression, OCD, and anxiety. [Why/how does captivity contribute to clinical depression, OCD, and anxiety?]

My opinion, based on the facts, is that zoos aren't necessary - they do have pros such as education about conservation efforts and saving species from extinction, but compromising the animals' mental and physical health isn't worth it. Possibly if they were changed to only help with breeding and release back into the wild, it would be better. But [Review word choice. (Ex.Nevertheless)] as it stands, I believe zoos need work.
