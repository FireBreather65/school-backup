Both essays talk about the pros and cons of higher education, but the argument against it is better argued and supported. Whereas the first (pro) argument speaks mainly about Obama's plans for higher education and degree attainment, the second (con) argument speaks more about the actual cons (and pros) of higher education.
[The thesis concludes the introduction by presenting what the rest of the essay will discuss. This prepares the reader for the upcoming discussion since they know what to expect. It also organizes the following paragraphs as the main idea of each should align with the thesis. To create a strong thesis, be specific in your word choices and present the ideas that will be detailed in the following paragraphs].

Although both sides agree that college graduates make more money, the pro argument neglects to include the fact of student loan debt, other than to state that student loan debt has now surpassed credit card debt. The con argument talks about student loan debt, and goes on to compare the earnings of high school graduates and college graduates.
[It is not clear what the argument is – as it has not been stated. To fix the issue – develop the first line of the paragraph to be a clear topic sentence that states the main idea of the entire paragraph and relates pack to the thesis. Review: topic sentences]

It concludes that - just using median incomes and average tuition fees - the college graduate will be behind the high school graduate financially for at least a decade after they both graduate high school, since the high school graduate has been working since they graduated unlike the university graduate.

Also, even though both sides agree that unemployment decreases with education, the pro side says that education is necessary for over half of the 30 fastest-growing occupations (meaning that there are a little under half that don't require post-secondary education). The con side references a Forbes Magazine article arguing that few jobs require a university education, and that what you learn at university isn't relevant to what you do on the job.

Both sides also agree that tuition and fees are ridiculously high, although the pro side does state that the Obama Administration worked to combat this. The con side, however, speaks about the fact that fees continue to rise, not fall.
[In the conclusion - Restate your thesis in a new way and summarize the main points of your body paragraphs. Then – develop a closing statement that leaves reader with final thought and/or call to action.]

The con side also notes that many people have made it without a degree, as long as they have drive and ideas. Tech moguls such as Mark Zuckerberg (founder of Facebook), Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft), and Steve Jobs (founder of Apple) don't have a degree, they actually dropped out of college/university. There's also Dave Thomas (founder of Wendy's) and Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Records, Virgin Atlantic, and now Virgin Galactic).
