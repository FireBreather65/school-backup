~ Microeconomics ~

Introduction to Economics:
- microeconomics is the study of individual actors (a firm, people, households)

- macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole

- microeconomics is how [individual] actors make decisions/allocations of scarce resources

- macroeconomics is how an aggregate economy works (from millions of individual actors)
^ like what will happen when you raise or lower taxes?

- in both, it kinda goes like this:
- philosophical ideas of decision-making -> (make assumptions/simplify) -> MATH -> conclusions??

Scarcity:
- scarce resources vs. free resources
^ scarce resources are limited, free resources are infinite

- examples of scarce resources:
	- human-made resources such as caviar
	- human resources such as labor
	- natural resources such as water

- examples of free resources:
	- also natural resources such as air/oxygen

Scarcity and Rivalry:
- when one person can limit the ability for others to use that same thing simultaneously, it's called a rival good (understood using cake analogy in video)

- lands, housing, roads during rush hour, even oxygen in an airtight room can be/are rival goods

- contrary to 2 examples above, the roads at 3am or air to breathe outside can be/are non-rival goods

Factors of Production:
- there are four main factors of production: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship

- the idea is that you need all of the above to keep things running

- in economic language, capital is something produced to produce other things (like tools, buildings, machinery, etc.)

- also in economic language, entrepreneurship is putting together all other factors in order to produce things
^ a related idea is tech, sometimes replaces entrepreneurship as one of the 4 main factors

- using these four factors, we could either produce something that can be used to produce more things, or we could produce consumption goods (the opposite)

Normative and Positive Statements:
- a normative statement is a matter of opinion or ethics

- a positive statement is something that doesn't HAVE to be true, but can be tested

- examples of normative statements:
	- "Paying people who aren't working, even though they could work, is wrong and unfair."
	- "The government should raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for helping the poor."

- examples of positive statements:
	- "Programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work."
	- "Raising taxes on the government programs grows the economy."
	- "Raising taxes on the wealthy slows economic growth."

Property Rights:
- no notes, just helpful to know and review

Markets and Property Rights:
- a broad (and informal) definition of a market is something formed when multiple parties exchange things of value

- in order to have a market, you need to have a notion that things are owned and can be sold (property rights)

- three qualities of property rights:
	- the idea that those rights are exclusive
	- the idea that those rights are enforceable
	- the idea that those rights are transferrable
