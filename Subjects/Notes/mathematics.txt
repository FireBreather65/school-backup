~ Algebra ~

Equations w/ Variables on Both Sides:
- if there aren't non-variable numbers on both sides (like example.png shows), skip that step

Number of Solutions to Equations:
- all you really have to do is simplify the equations like above, then use the following table:
	- there are no solutions if you get a nonsensical answer (like 3 = 5)
	- there is one solution if you get an answer like x = 5 (where the variable is variable, and could totally be that!)
	- there are infinite solutions if you get an answer that's always equivalent (like 13 = 13)

~

Linear Equations w/ Unknown Coefficents:
- move all (answer variable) terms to one side of the equation, and move all other terms to the other side of the equation
- using the distributive property, group like terms together on both sides of the equation (if necessary)
- to isolate (answer variable), divide both sides by the coefficents of (answer variable)

Inequalities w/ Variables on Both Sides:
- literally is the same as above (equations w/ variables on both sides)
^ but with the division, if you divide by a negative number switch the symbol (e.g. [> to <] or [< to >])

Compound Inequalities:
- on both of the below accounts, all you have to do is solve the equations...am I missing something??
^ it's also helpful to draw a little number line (to see where overlap is)

~ Geometry ~

Terms & Labels in Geometry:
- a point is a point, you can't move from it (or else you'd have a different point)

- a line segment is a straight line with two endpoints, denoted by a line over the letters

- a ray is a straight line (with only one endpoint) that extends infinitely in one direction, denoted by an arrow over the letters (PAY ATTENTION TO ORDER OF LETTERS)

- a line is a straight infinite path joining an infinite number of points in both directions, denoted by a dual arrow

- colinear points are points that are on the same line segment, ray, or line

- a midpoint is a point that is exactly halfway between two locations (which can be other points)

- a plane is an infinite two-dimensional surface (like an infinite piece of paper)

- a plane segment is a non-infinite two-dimensional surface (like a regular piece of paper 😂)

Rigid Transformations Intro:
- examples of rigid transformations are:
	- translations (simply moving a given point or shape)
	- rotations (turning a given point or shape relative to an arbitrary point)
	- reflections (reflecting a given point or shape across an arbitrary line)
	- any transformation where lengths AND angles are preserved

- examples of NOT rigid transformations are:
	- dilation (where shapes are scaled up or down relative to their original size, lengths aren't preserved)
	- stretching (where shapes are stretched in any way, both angles and lengths are potentially not preserved)

Rotating Points:
- positive rotation = counterclockwise (aka to the left)
- negative rotation = clockwise (aka to the right)

~

Rotating Shapes:
- as a general rule:
	- for a (positive) 90 degree rotation about (0, 0), (x, y) = (−y, x)
	- for a (negative) 90 degree rotation about (0, 0), (x, y) = (y, −x)
	- for a 180 degree rotation about (0, 0), (x, y) = (-x, -y)

~

Reflecting Points:
- when it comes to reflecting points across an axis, add/remove the negative sign from the OPPOSITE axis' coordinate (see video if still confused)
^ also applies to reflecting shapes

~

Determining Reflections:
- steps to find reflection:
	- find coordinates for two different points e.g. (-4, -4) and (2, -6)
	- take x coordinates added together and y coordinates added together, and divide both by 2
	- repeat to another point on the line of reflection

^ probably won't be needed...but just in case 😉
^ this can be used for shapes as well, just fyi
