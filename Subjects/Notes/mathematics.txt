Terms & Labels in Geometry:
- a point is a point, you can't move from it (or else you'd have a different point)

- a line segment connects two points, denoted by a line over the letters

- an endpoint is one of two ends of a line segment

- a ray is like a line segment, except there isn't a second endpoint (you can presumably go on forever), denoted by an arrow over the letters (PAY ATTENTION TO ORDER OF LETTERS)

- a line is also like a line segment (or a ray), but you can keep going in BOTH directions (unlike a ray), denoted by a dual arrow

- colinear points are points that are on the same line and/or line segment

- a midpoint is pretty self-explanatory, video below if truly needed

- a plane is an infinite two-dimensional surface (you can go right, left, up, and/or down)

- a plane segment is a non-infinite two-dimensional surface (like a piece of paper)
