Terms & Labels in Geometry:
- a point is a point, you can't move from it (or else you'd have a different point)

- a line segment is a straight line with two endpoints, denoted by a line over the letters

- a ray is a straight line (with only one endpoint) that extends infinitely in one direction, denoted by an arrow over the letters (PAY ATTENTION TO ORDER OF LETTERS)

- a line is a straight infinite path joining an infinite number of points in both directions, denoted by a dual arrow

- colinear points are points that are on the same line segment, ray, or line

- a midpoint is a point that is exactly halfway between two locations (which can be other points)

- a plane is an infinite two-dimensional surface (you can go right, left, up, and/or down)=

- a plane segment is a non-infinite two-dimensional surface (like a piece of paper)
