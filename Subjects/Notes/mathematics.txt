Terms & Labels in Geometry:
- a point is a point, you can't move from it (or else you'd have a different point)

- a line segment is a straight line with two endpoints, denoted by a line over the letters

- a ray is a straight line (with only one endpoint) that extends infinitely in one direction, denoted by an arrow over the letters (PAY ATTENTION TO ORDER OF LETTERS)

- a line is a straight infinite path joining an infinite number of points in both directions, denoted by a dual arrow

- colinear points are points that are on the same line segment, ray, or line

- a midpoint is a point that is exactly halfway between two locations (which can be other points)

- a plane is an infinite two-dimensional surface (you can go right, left, up, and/or down)

- a plane segment is a non-infinite two-dimensional surface (like a piece of paper)

^ although I don't have notes, this video is really helpful

Specifying Planes in 3D:
- one or two points cannot define a plane, but three can (as long as they aren't colinear)

Angles: Introduction:
- an angle is defined as two rays sharing the same endpoint (the angle vertex), denoted by an angle symbol next to the letters

- the angle symbol looks like a less than sign, except the bottom is flat

- as for what order to denote an angle, start on either side of the angle vertex (like the video)
