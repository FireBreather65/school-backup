Equations w/ Variables on Both Sides:
- if there aren't non-variable numbers on both sides (like example.png shows), skip that step

~ Geometry ~

Terms & Labels in Geometry:
- a point is a point, you can't move from it (or else you'd have a different point)

- a line segment is a straight line with two endpoints, denoted by a line over the letters

- a ray is a straight line (with only one endpoint) that extends infinitely in one direction, denoted by an arrow over the letters (PAY ATTENTION TO ORDER OF LETTERS)

- a line is a straight infinite path joining an infinite number of points in both directions, denoted by a dual arrow

- colinear points are points that are on the same line segment, ray, or line

- a midpoint is a point that is exactly halfway between two locations (which can be other points)

- a plane is an infinite two-dimensional surface (like an infinite piece of paper)

- a plane segment is a non-infinite two-dimensional surface (like a regular piece of paper 😂)

Rigid Transformations Intro:
- examples of rigid transformations are:
	- translations (simply moving a given point or shape)
	- rotations (turning a given point or shape relative to an arbitrary point)
	- reflections (reflecting a given point or shape across an arbitrary line)
	- any transformation where lengths AND angles are preserved

- examples of NOT rigid transformations are:
	- dilation (where shapes are scaled up or down relative to their original size, lengths aren't preserved)
	- stretching (where shapes are stretched in any way, both angles and lengths are potentially not preserved)
