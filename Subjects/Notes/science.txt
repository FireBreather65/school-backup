The Scientific Method:
- structured steps of the scientific method:
	1. Observation (ex. noticing that pond freezes over faster and at higher temperatures than the ocean in Northern Canada)

	2. Ask a Question (ex. Why does [the above] happen?)

	3. Create a Hypothesis (ex. salt water has a lower freezing point, therefore requiring colder temperatures than fresh water)
	^ a bad hypothesis could be thinking that, say, a fairy performs magic on the pond to freeze it faster (because it's not testable)

	4. Make a Prediction (ex. saying that the fresh freezes at 0°C, and salt doesn't)
	
	5. Design an Experiment (ex. taking two cups, one has distilled water, other has same water with a bunch of salt, putting both in freezer)

	6. Ask Further Questions (ex. When does salt water freeze? Do the waves or wind have an impact?)

	7. Iterate + Refine Experiment (ex. revise hypothesis and/or test again)

Introduction to Experimental Design:
- randomly sort people into two groups (to eliminate implicit bias)

- give both of them the thing being tested (in the video's case, it was a pill), making one of them "empty" and the other the real thing

- double-blind study basically means keeping both givers and receivers in the dark (so nothing is suspected nor is information subconciously provided)

- make your experiment replicable (so skeptical people can be put at ease)

Elements and Atoms:
- elements are pure substances that have specific properties at certain temperatures and react in certain ways

- atoms are smaller chunks of elements, made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons (WHAAA)

- protons define the element, as the atomic number of an element is the # of protons; they're also in the nucleus (positive charge)
^ say you had carbon (6); you can't add (or subtract) protons, or else it would be a different element like nitrogen (7)

- electrons are attracted to protons (opposites attract 😉); in a neutral atom the number of protons are the same as the number of electrons, they orbit the nucleus (negative charge)

- neutrons are found by subtracting the mass number from the atomic number, they're also in the nucleus (no charge)

- the relation of protons to electrons determines whether a atom has a net positive or negative charge (considered an ion if there are an unequal number of protons and electrons)
^ further information: a cation has a positive charge, an anion has a negative charge

Hydrogen Bonding in Water:
- H2O can be broken down into 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom

- an electronegative atom basically means that said atom "hogs" electrons
^ oxygen, for example, is an electronegative atom

- a hydrogen bond happens when the oxygen atom (which has a partially negative charge) in a water molecule bonds with a hydrogen atom in another molecule (which has a partially positive charge, as the electrons that would make it negative are "surrounding" the oxygen atom)

~

Water as a Solvent:
- table salt dissolves in water due to water being a solvent

- expanding on above (and being more technical), you need to watch the video - it's so cool (and I'm not able to articulate right now XD)

- hydrophilic (water loving) vs. hydrophobic (water fearing)

- cohesion is the attraction for other molecules of the same kind, adhesion is the attraction for other molecules of a different kind

~

Introduction to pH:
- pH stands for power/potential of H (hydrogen)

- on a scale of 0 to 14, 0 through 6.9 is acidic, 7.6 through 14 is alkaline, and anything else is neutral

- acidic things have lots of H+ (hydrogen ions), and alkaline things react with H+ (hydrogen ions)

Scale of Cells:
- cells -> atoms -> molecules

- not sure where viruses fit in...

~

Introduction to the Cell:
- a cell is the most basic unit of life (although some believe that a virus is)

- the cell membrane is what separates a cell from the outside world

- the plasma membrane is what separates a cell's interior from its surrounding environment

- the cytoplasm consists of jelly-like cytosol, plus the cellular structures suspended in it.
^ in eukaryotes, cytoplasm specifically means the region outside the nucleus but inside the plasma membrane

- ribosomoes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins

- in our bodies, mature blood cells don't have DNA anymore (OMG 😲)

~

Fluid Mosaic Model of Cell Membranes:
- called fluid mosaic model because it's basically a tapestry of several types of molecules (phospholipids, cholesterols, and proteins) that are constantly on the move (very fluid)

- a phospholipid is a lipid that involves a phosphate group (doesn't dissolve well in water)

- phospholipids are amphipathic, meaning they have a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end

- a phospholipid bilayer involves two layers of phospholipids with their hydrophobic tails pointing inward

- the amphipathic property of phospholipids causes semipermeability of the cell membrane

~

Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells:
- a cell is eukaryotic when there are membrane-bound organelles inside the cell

- organelles are specialized cell structures that perform a specific function

organelles and their functions:
	- the nucleus stores genetic information and controls all cell activities

	- the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of tubes and membranes that carry material through the cell, modify proteins, and synthesize lipids
	^ has two parts: rough ER (which contains ribosomes) and smooth ER (which doesn't)

	- a golgi body is made of flattened membrane discs that modify, sort, and package proteins

	- the mitochondria breaks down sugar into energy for the cell (called the powerhouse due to so)

	- the chloroplast uses light energy to make food for plant cells (specific to plant/algae cells, never animal cells)
	^ that's how you can tell what kind of cell (plant vs. animal) you're looking at!!
	^ as well as if it contains a cell wall (only plant cells have them)

	- the vacuole stores food, water, and waste
	^ a large central vacuole helps maintain the shape of plant cells, whereas animal cells have many, smaller vacuoles

	- the lysosome, made up of enzymes, breaks down large molecules and digests old cell parts

~

Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells:
- largest distinction is that a eukaryote specifically has a membrane-bound nucleus; a prokaryote instead has a nucleoid

- another distinction is that prokaryotes don't have any membrane-bound organelles, whereas a eukaryote does

- last distinction is that the DNA in eurkaryotes are multiple linear chromosomes found in the nucleus, whereas prokaryotes are single, circular, and free-floating in cytoplasm (can also wind around and around, but always closes up)

- eurkaryotes are also typically larger, and prokaryotes are typically smaller

- examples of eurkayotes are all multicellular (and some unicellular) organisms, such as animals, plants, fungi, protists

- examples of prokaryotes are bacteria and archaea (always unicellular)

Introduction to Metabolism:
- metabolism is made up of two processes:
	- catabolism, where large molecules are broken down into small ones (energy is released, making it an exergonic reaction)
	- anabolism, where small molecules are assembled into large ones (energy is required, making it an endergonic reaction)

- the material that plants and trees are made of is actually carbon
^ it comes from them come from them rearranging carbon dioxide, taking the carbon from it and turning it from a gas to a solid form (the plant)

Enzymes:
- a catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction WITHOUT being charged (an enzyme is an example of this)

- the substrate is the reactant molecule that an enzyme works on (binds with an enzyme at the active site)

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-enzymes/v/enzymes

Intro to Passive and Active Transport:
- passive transport would be going with the current, active transport is going against it (using the canoeing analogy provided)

~

Introduction to Diffusion:
- diffusion is basically the stabilizing of a given concentration gradient (from a high/low or low/high gradient to no gradient)
^ uses passive transport

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-passive-and-active-transport/v/diffusion-video

~

Concentration Gradients:
- a concentration gradient is a region of space over which the concentration of substance changes

- they move irrespective to the other moving particles

- facilitated diffusion is the passive movement of molecules along the concentration gradient (FACILITATED by membrane proteins)

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-passive-and-active-transport/v/concentration-gradients

~

Osmosis:
- defined as the net movement of water across a semipermeable (aka selectively permeable) membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration
^ passive transport process

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-osmosis-and-tonicity/v/osmosis

~

Tonicity:
- defined as the ability of an extracellular solution to make water move into or out of a cell by osmosis (defined above)

- three types of tonicity:
	- hypertonic, where there's a higher concentration of solute in the solution surrounding the cell than in the cell (water moves out of the cell here)

	- isotonic, where there's an equal amount of solute in the solution surrounding the cell and in the cell (water moves in and out of the cell at the same time here)

	- hypotonic, where there's a lower concentration of solute in the solution surrounding the cell than in the cell (water moves into the cell here)

~

Photosynthesis:
- photosynthesis is a plant process where light (photo) energy is used to (synthesize) sugar (also releases molecular oxygen) <- occurs in the chloroplast

- also requires water and carbon dioxide alongside the light <- the basic things that kids are taught to give plants

- there are two stages: 
	- the light-dependent reactions (which happens in the thylakoid membrane), where water and light are taken to produce ATP (a source of energy), NADPH (a strong reducing agent, also contains energy), and molecular oxygen (a bi-product)

	- the Calvin cycle (which happens in the stroma) takes the products of the light-dependent reactions along with carbon dioxide to produce and store more energy in the form of sugar

- although not brought up in the video, a photoautotroph is an organism that produces its own food using light energy (like plants)

- another cool thing not brought up in the video is the fact that plants are green because chlorophyll reflects green light (instead absorbs red and blue light)

- yet another fact not included in the video is in photosynthesis, carbon dioxide, water, and light energy react, which forms glucose and oxygen

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-photosynthesis/v/breaking-down-photosynthesis-stages

~

Cellular Respiration:
- cellular respiration synthesizes glucose into energy (similar to light-dependent reactions during photosynthesis)
^ occurs in the mitochondria

- in a more involved fashion, if you one mole of glucose and six moles of oxygen, put it through cellular respiration, the product is six moles of carbon dioxide, six moles of water, and, most importantly, energy

- both ATP and glucose are the "energy currency" of biological systems

- energy produces both heat and 38 ATPs <- weirdly specific number lmao

- regarding the strangely specific 38 ATPs, it's an ideal number (in reality, it's more along the lines of 30 ATPs), but these theories are still being studied

- parts of cellular respiration:
	- glycolysis (the first stage), an anaerobic process where glucose is broken up from 6 carbon moles to a pair of 3 carbon moles (requires 2 ATPs, generates 4 ATPs, net +2 ATPs)
	^ if oxygen isn't available, the byproducts of glycolosis go through a side process called fermentation (as the next 3 stages require oxygen)

	- the Krebs cycle (the second stage), an aerobic process where the broken down glucose (aka pyruvate) gets further broken down into carbon dioxide (requires ? ATPs, generates 2 ATPs, net ? ATPs)

	- the electron transport chain (the third stage), an aerobic process where NADHs and FADH2 produced in the above two stages are used to produce ATPs (requires ? ATPs, generates 34 ATPs, net ? ATPS)

Asexual and Sexual Reproduction:
- asexual reproduction is the process of creating new individual using one parent organism

- sexual reproduction is the process of creating new individuals using two parent organisms

- binary fission is where one parent organism doubles its DNA, then splits into two organisms (applies to prokaryotes)

- mitosis is where one parent organism doubles its DNA, then splits into two organisms (applies to eurkaryotes)

- budding is where there is growth on the surface of a parent organism, therefore forming two individuals (applies to yeast and some special animals)

- fragmentation is where a parent organism breaks into two or more fragments, which develop into a new individual (applies to many plants and some special animals)

- parthenogenesis is where an embryo develops from an unfertilized cell (applies to invertebrates and some fish, amphibians, reptiles)

Chromosomes, Chromatids, and Chromatin:
- chromatin -> chromatid -> chromosome

- haploid cells = n, diploid cells = 2n

- homologous pair chromosomes usually have the same genes at the same relative locations (loci)
^ "usually" because it's possible that they have different alleles
