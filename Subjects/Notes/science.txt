Cell Specialization:
- cells are the fundamental unit of life, they:
  - take in nutrients
	- convert them into energy 
	- produce things that the body needs
^ but not all cells do all of these things

- proteins help carry out cell processes, they:
  - provide structural support
	- aid in chemical reactions
	- build/repair cells

- cell specialization itself is the process where a cell takes on a specific structure and function
^ largely based on which proteins are present or absent in the cell

- groups of specialized cells are organized into tissues
