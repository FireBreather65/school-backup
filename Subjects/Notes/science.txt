The Scientific Method:
- structured steps of the scientific method:
	1. Observation (ex. noticing that pond freezes over faster and at higher temperatures than the ocean in Northern Canada)

	2. Ask a Question (ex. Why does [the above] happen?)

	3. Create a Hypothesis (ex. salt water has a lower freezing point, therefore requiring colder temperatures than fresh water)
	^ a bad hypothesis could be thinking that, say, a fairy performs magic on the pond to freeze it faster (because it's not testable)

	4. Make a Prediction (ex. saying that the fresh freezes at 0°C, and salt doesn't)
	
	5. Design an Experiment (ex. taking two cups, one has distilled water, other has same water with a bunch of salt, putting both in freezer)

	6. Ask Further Questions (ex. When does salt water freeze? Do the waves or wind have an impact?)

	7. Iterate + Refine Experiment (ex. revise hypothesis and/or test again)

Data to Justify Experimental Claims:
- although there are no notes, it will be helpful for GED prep (data analysis of scientific graphs)

Introduction to Experimental Design:
- randomly sort people into two groups (to eliminate implicit bias)

- give both of them the thing being tested (in the video's case, it was a pill), making one of them "empty" and the other the real thing

- double-blind study basically means keeping both givers and receivers in the dark (so nothing is suspected nor is information subconciously provided)

- make your experiment replicable (so skeptical people can be put at ease)

Elements and Atoms:
- elements are pure substances that have specific properties at certain temperatures and react in certain ways

- atoms are smaller chunks of elements, made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons (WHAAA)

- protons define the element, as the atomic number of an element is the # of protons; they're also in the nucleus (positive charge)
^ say you had carbon (6); you can't add (or subtract) protons, or else it would be a different element like nitrogen (7)

- electrons are attracted to protons (opposites attract 😉); in a neutral atom the number of protons are the same as the number of electrons, they orbit the nucleus (negative charge)

- neutrons are found by subtracting the mass number from the atomic number, they're also in the nucleus (no charge)

- the relation of protons to electrons determines whether a atom has a net positive or negative charge (considered an ion if there are an unequal number of protons and electrons)
^ further information: a cation has a positive charge, an anion has a negative charge

Hydrogen Bonding in Water:
- H2O can be broken down into 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom

- an electronegative atom basically means that said atom "hogs" electrons
^ oxygen, for example, is an electronegative atom

- a hydrogen bond happens when the oxygen atom (which has a partially negative charge) in a water molecule bonds with a hydrogen atom in another molecule (which has a partially positive charge, as the electrons that would make it negative are "surrounding" the oxygen atom)

Water as a Solvent:
- table salt dissolves in water due to water being a solvent

- expanding on above (and being more technical), you need to watch the video - it's so cool (and I'm not able to articulate right now XD)

- hydrophilic (water loving) vs. hydrophobic (water fearing)

- cohesion is the attraction for other molecules of the same kind, adhesion is the attraction for other molecules of a different kind

Introduction to pH:
- pH stands for power/potential of H (hydrogen)

- on a scale of 0 to 14, 0 through 6.9 is acidic, 7.6 through 14 is alkaline, and anything else is neutral

- acidic things have lots of H+ (hydrogen ions), and alkaline things react with H+ (hydrogen ions)

Scale of Cells:
- cells -> atoms -> molecules

- not sure where viruses fit in...

Introduction to the Cell:
- a cell is the most basic unit of life (although some believe that a virus is)

- the cell membrane is what separates a cell from the outside world

- the cytoplasm is the stuff inside the cell (not very technical haha)
^ the "stuff inside the cell" contains cytosol, a jelly-like fluid that holds all else

- a ribosome is made up of protein structures (and they produce protein???)

- in our bodies, mature blood cells don't have DNA anymore (OMG 😲)
