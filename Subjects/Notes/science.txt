Cell Specialization:
- cells are the fundamental unit of life, they:
  - take in nutrients
	- convert them into energy 
	- produce things that the body needs
^ but not all cells do all of these things

- proteins help carry out cell processes, they:
  - provide structural support
	- aid in chemical reactions
	- build/repair cells
	- catalyze chemical reactions
	- send "messages"

- groups of specialized cells are organized into tissues

- cell specialization itself is the process where a cell takes on a specific structure and function
^ largely based on which proteins are present or absent in the cell (the unique protein combos)

- all cells in an organism (like Bob the Beta Fish) have the same DNA + genes, but different protein combinations (see below if confused about DNA and genes)

Genes, Proteins, and Cells:
- genes are basic hereditary units, they:
  - are passed down from parent to offspring
	- contain information about an organism's traits
	- can have different versions of a single gene (called alleles)
	^ for example, same gene (color gene) but different versions (blue gene, green gene, etc.)
	- many genes encode proteins (chains of amino acids)
	^ they have "instructions" on creating these chains
  - different alleles have different nucleotide sequences, which likely encode different proteins (everything's different haha)

- DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, it is:
  - a macromolecule (aka complex molecule)
	- like a "cookbook" of genetic information
	- consists of subunits called nucleotides (A, T, C, G)
	- keeping with the analogy, genes are "recipes" within the larger "cookbook"
