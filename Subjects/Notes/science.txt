The Scientific Method:
- structured steps of the scientific method:
	1. Observation (ex. noticing that pond freezes over faster and at higher temperatures than the ocean in Northern Canada)

	2. Ask a Question (ex. Why does [the above] happen?)

	3. Create a Hypothesis (ex. salt water has a lower freezing point, therefore requiring colder temperatures than fresh water)
	^ a bad hypothesis could be thinking that, say, a fairy performs magic on the pond to freeze it faster (because it's not testable)

	4. Make a Prediction (ex. saying that the fresh freezes at 0°C, and salt doesn't)
	
	5. Design an Experiment (ex. taking two cups, one has distilled water, other has same water with a bunch of salt, putting both in freezer)

	6. Ask Further Questions (ex. When does salt water freeze? Do the waves or wind have an impact?)

	7. Iterate + Refine Experiment (ex. revise hypothesis and/or test again)

Introduction to Experimental Design:
- randomly sort people into two groups (to eliminate implicit bias)

- give both of them the thing being tested (in the video's case, it was a pill), making one of them "empty" and the other the real thing

- double-blind study basically means keeping both givers and receivers in the dark (so nothing is suspected nor is information subconciously provided)

- make your experiment replicable (so skeptical people can be put at ease)

Elements and Atoms:
- elements are pure substances that have specific properties at certain temperatures and react in certain ways

- atoms are smaller chunks of elements, made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons (WHAAA)

- protons define the element, as the atomic number of an element is the # of protons; they're also in the nucleus (positive charge)
^ say you had carbon (6); you can't add (or subtract) protons, or else it would be a different element like nitrogen (7)

- electrons are attracted to protons (opposites attract 😉); in a neutral atom the number of protons are the same as the number of electrons, they orbit the nucleus (negative charge)

- neutrons are found by subtracting the mass number from the atomic number, they're also in the nucleus (no charge)

- the relation of protons to electrons determines whether a atom has a net positive or negative charge (considered an ion if there are an unequal number of protons and electrons)
^ further information: a cation has a positive charge, an anion has a negative charge

Hydrogen Bonding in Water:
- H2O can be broken down into 2 hydrogen atoms, 1 oxygen atom

- an electronegative atom basically means that said atom "hogs" electrons
^ oxygen, for example, is an electronegative atom

- a hydrogen bond happens when the oxygen atom (which has a partially negative charge) in a water molecule bonds with a hydrogen atom in another molecule (which has a partially positive charge, as the electrons that would make it negative are "surrounding" the oxygen atom)

~

Water as a Solvent:
- table salt dissolves in water due to water being a solvent

- expanding on above (and being more technical), you need to watch the video - it's so cool (and I'm not able to articulate right now XD)

- hydrophilic (water loving) vs. hydrobic (water fearing)

- cohesion is the attraction for other molecules of the same kind, adhesion is the attraction for other molecules of a different kind

~

Introduction to pH:
- pH stands for power/potential of H (hydrogen)

- on a scale of 0 to 14, 0 through 6.9 is acidic, 7.6 through 14 is alkaline, and anything else is neutral

- acidic things have lots of H+ (hydrogen ions), and alkaline things react with H+ (hydrogen ions)

Scale of Cells:
- cells -> atoms -> molecules

- not sure where viruses fit in...

~

Introduction to the Cell:
- a cell is the most basic unit of life (although some believe that a virus is)

- the cell membrane is what separates a cell from the outside world

- the plasma membrane is what separates a cell's interior from its surrounding environment

- the cytoplasm consists of jelly-like cytosol, plus the cellular structures suspended in it.
^ in eukaryotes, cytoplasm specifically means the region outside the nucleus but inside the plasma membrane

- ribosomoes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins

- in our bodies, mature blood cells don't have DNA anymore (OMG 😲)

~

Fluid Mosaic Model of Cell Membranes:
- called fluid mosaic model because it's basically a tapestry of several types of molecules (phospholipids, cholesterols, and proteins) that are constantly on the move (very fluid)

- a phospholipid is a lipid that involves a phosphate group (doesn't dissolve well in water)

- phospholipids are amphipathic, meaning they have a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end

- a phospholipid bilayer involves two layers of phospholipids with their hydrophobic tails pointing inward

- the amphipathic property of phospholipids causes semipermeability of the cell membrane

Organelles in Eukaryotic Cells:
- a cell is eukaryotic when there are membrane-bound organelles inside the cell

- organelles are specialized cell structures that perform a specific function

organelles and their functions:
	- the nucleus stores genetic information and controls all cell activities

	- the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of tubes and membranes that carry material through the cell, modify proteins, and synthesize lipids
	^ has two parts: rough ER (which contains ribosomes) and smooth ER (which doesn't)

	- a golgi body is made of flattened membrane discs that modify, sort, and package proteins

	- the mitochondria breaks down sugar into energy for the cell (called the powerhouse due to so)

	- the chloroplast uses light energy to make food for plant cells (specific to plant/algae cells, never animal cells)
	^ that's how you can tell what kind of cell (plant vs. animal) you're looking at!!
	^ as well as if it contains a cell wall (only plant cells have them)

	- the vacuole stores food, water, and waste
	^ a large central vacuole helps maintain the shape of plant cells, whereas animal cells have many, smaller vacuoles

	- the lysosome, made up of enzymes, breaks down large molecules and digests old cell parts

Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells:
- largest distinction is that a eukaryote specifically has a membrane-bound nucleus; a prokaryote instead has a nucleoid

- another distinction is that prokaryotes don't have any membrane-bound organelles, whereas a eukaryote does

- last distinction is that the DNA in eurkaryotes are multiple linear chromosomes found in the nucleus, whereas prokaryotes are single, circular, and free-floating in cytoplasm (can also wind around and around, but always closes up)

- eurkaryotes are also typically larger, and prokaryotes are typically smaller

- examples of eurkayotes are all multicellular (and some unicellular) organisms, such as animals, plants, fungi, protists

- examples of prokaryotes are bacteria and archaea (always unicellular)

Introduction to Metabolism:
- metabolism is made up of two processes:
	- catabolism, where large molecules are broken down into small ones (energy is released, making it an exergonic reaction)
	- anabolism, where small molecules are assembled into large ones (energy is required, making it an endergonic reaction)

- the material that plants and trees are made of is actually carbon
^ it comes from them come from them rearranging carbon dioxide, taking the carbon from it and turning it from a gas to a solid form (the plant)

^ boring (and lengthy), but useful

~

Enzymes:
- a catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction WITHOUT being charged (an enzyme is an example of this)

- the substrate is the reactant molecule that an enzyme works on (binds with an enzyme at the active site)

Intro to Passive and Active Transport:
- passive transport would be going with the current, active transport is going against it (using the canoeing analogy provided)

~

Introduction to Diffusion:
- diffusion is basically the stabilizing of a given concentration gradient (from a high/low or low/high gradient to no gradient)
^ uses passive transport

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-passive-and-active-transport/v/diffusion-video

~

Concentration Gradients:
- a concentration gradient is a region of space over which the concentration of substance changes

- they move irrespective to the other moving particles

~

Osmosis:
- defined as the net movement of water across a semipermeable (aka selectively permeable) membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration
^ passive transport process

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-energy-and-transport/hs-osmosis-and-tonicity/v/osmosis

~

Tonicity:
- defined as the ability of an extracellular solution to make water move into or out of a cell by osmosis (defined above)

- three types of tonicity:
	- hypertonic, where there's a higher concentration of solute in the solution surrounding the cell than in the cell (water moves out of the cell here)

	- isotonic, where there's an equal amount of solute in the solution surrounding the cell and in the cell (water moves in and out of the cell at the same time here)

	- hypotonic, where there's a lower concentration of solute in the solution surrounding the cell than in the cell (water moves into the cell here)
