Cell Specialization:
- cells are the fundamental unit of life, they:
  - take in nutrients
	- convert them into energy 
	- produce things that the body needs
^ but not all cells do all of these things

- proteins help carry out cell processes, they:
  - provide structural support
	- aid in chemical reactions
	- build/repair cells
	- catalyze chemical reactions
	- send "messages"

- groups of specialized cells are organized into tissues

- cell specialization itself is the process where a cell takes on a specific structure and function
^ largely based on which proteins are present or absent in the cell (the unique protein combos)

- all cells in an organism (like Bob the Beta Fish) have the same DNA + genes, but different protein combinations (see below if confused about DNA and genes)

Genes, Proteins, and Cells:
- genes are basic hereditary units, they:
  - are passed down from parent to offspring
	- contain information about an organism's traits
	- can have different versions of a single gene (called alleles)
	^ for example, same gene (color gene) but different versions (blue gene, green gene, etc.)
	- many genes encode proteins (chains of amino acids)
	^ they have "instructions" on creating these chains
  - different alleles have different nucleotide sequences, which likely encode different proteins (everything's different haha)

- DNA stands for DeoxyriboNucleic Acid, it is:
  - a macromolecule (aka complex molecule)
	- like a "cookbook" of genetic information
	- consists of subunits called nucleotides (A, T, C, G)
	- keeping with the analogy, genes are "recipes" within the larger "cookbook"

Organization of Multicellular Organisms:
- order is cell, tissue, organs, organ system, organism

Cell Division and Organism Growth:
- each organism starts off as a cell (the result of a fusion between sperm and egg, aka two gametes)

- each gamete has half of the genetic material needed to make that organism

- once the above fusion has happened, you're now diploid (whereas before, you were haploid)

- mitosis is the process of cell division (where a parent cell divides into two daughter cells, genetically identical to the parent cell)

- chromosomes are long strands of DNA located in the nucleus of the cell

stages of mitosis:
	- prophase (early [where the mitotic spindle starts to form, chromosomes start to condense, nucleolus disappears] v. late [nuclear envelope breaks down, chromosomes are fully condensed])
	- metaphase (chromosomes line up at metaphase plate aka the center)
	- anaphase (sister chromosomes get pulled toward poles, poles get pushed apart)
	- telophase (mitotic spindle disappears, nuclear membrane reforms, nucleolus reappears, chromosomes start to decondense)
	- cytokinesis (actual complete division of cell)

Feedback in Living Systems:
- physiological responses are the internal changes our bodies carry out UNCONCIOUSLY, whereas behavioral responses are the actions we carry out CONCIOUSLY in response to needs

- physiological responses to hot temperatures include sweating and thirst, and behavioral responses to hot temperatures include finding shade and drinking water

- homeostasis is the tendency to maintain internal conditions despite changes in external conditions

- organisms maintain homeostatis with negative feedback loops (which counteract stimuli) and positive feedback loops (which amplify stimuli)

negative feedback loop:
- stimulus (detectable change in internal conditions) -> detection (detection of that detectable change, if you will) -> response (counteraction of change)

positive feedback loop:
- stimulus (detectable change in internal conditions) -> detection (detection of that detectable change, if you will) -> response (amplification of change)

- thermoregulation is the process of maintaining body temperature at an acceptable range (neg.)

- osmoregulation is the process of keeping salt concentration in an organism at an acceptable range (neg.)

- childbirth is the process of birthing a child (pos.)
