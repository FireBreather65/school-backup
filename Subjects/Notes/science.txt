The Scientific Method:
- structured steps of the scientific method:
	1. Observation (ex. noticing that pond freezes over faster and at higher temperatures than the ocean in Northern Canada)

	2. Ask a Question (ex. Why does [the above] happen?)

	3. Create a Hypothesis (ex. salt water has a lower freezing point, therefore requiring colder temperatures than fresh water)
	^ a bad hypothesis could be thinking that, say, a fairy performs magic on the pond to freeze it faster (because it's not testable)

	4. Make a Prediction (ex. saying that the fresh freezes at 0°C, and salt doesn't)
	
	5. Design an Experiment (ex. taking two cups, one has distilled water, other has same water with a bunch of salt, putting both in freezer)

	6. Ask Further Questions (ex. When does salt water freeze? Do the waves or wind have an impact?)

	7. Iterate + Refine Experiment (ex. revise hypothesis and/or test again)

Data to Justify Experimental Claims:
- although there are no notes, it will be helpful for GED prep (data analysis of scientific graphs)

Introduction to Experimental Design:
- randomly sort people into two groups (to eliminate implicit bias)

- give both of them the thing being tested (in the video's case, it was a pill), making one of them "empty" and the other the real thing

- double-blind study basically means keep everyone in the dark (so nothing is suspected or subconciously provided)

- make your experiment replicable (so skeptical people can be put at ease)
