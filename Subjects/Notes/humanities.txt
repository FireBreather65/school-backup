~ US History ~

Thinking Like a Historian:
- N/A

Source Identification:
- primary source is the main source, such as:
  - photography
	- a diary
	- a speech
	- even a shopping list (depending on what you're researching)

- secondary source is your interpretation of what happened

Analyzing a Historical Text:
- find out what the people are vs. aren't talking about
^ using the photography analogy, what's outside their view? What's inside their view?

- also find out what the source can tell you (and what it doesn't tell you)

Avoiding Common Mistakes in Historical Essays:
- avoid the following sayings:
  - "Throughout history..."
	- "It was inevitable..."
	- "And that's why [insert country] is so great today!"

- instead use:
  - "In the [insert specific time period] in the [insert place(s)]"
	- "The [insert catalyst] caused [insert effect of catalyst]"
