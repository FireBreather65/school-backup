~ US History ~

Thinking Like a Historian:
- N/A

~

Source Identification:
- primary source is the main source, such as:
  - photography
	- a diary
	- a speech
	- even a shopping list (depending on what you're researching)

- secondary source is your interpretation of what happened

~

Analyzing a Historical Text:
- find out what the people are vs. aren't talking about
^ using the photography analogy, what's outside their view? What's inside their view?

- also find out what the source can tell you (and what it doesn't tell you)

~

Avoiding Common Mistakes in Historical Essays:
- avoid the following sayings:
  - "Throughout history..."
	- "It was inevitable..."
	- "And that's why [insert country] is so great today!"

- instead use:
  - "In the [insert specific time period] in the [insert place(s)]"
	- "The [insert catalyst] caused [insert effect of catalyst]"

Spanish Colonization:
- Encomiendas (a combination of feudalism and slavery)
- it granted land holders the right to labor of Native Americans (WHA??)
- anything they produced through their slave labor gave them Christianization and "protection" of Spanish feudal lords (aka encomenderos)

- the Native population shrunk to 10% of its' former size, so they started using enslaved Africans for labor instead

- adopting Christianity outwardly, while keeping their ancestral beliefs inwardly

- the Pueblo Revolt included:
	- killing Spanish priests
	- burning churches (replacing them with kivas)
	- driving the Spanish out	

- racial caste system (ranked individuals by how much Spanish was in their blood, the higher amount, the more legal rights you have)"

Highest: Peninsulares (children of two Spaniards born in Spain)
2nd Highest: Criollos (children of two Spaniards born in America)
2nd Lowest: Mestizos (children of a Spaniard + Native American) and Mulatoes (children of a Spaniard + African slave)
Lowest: Indios (children of two Native American parents) and Negroes (children of two African parents)

Comparing European and Native [...] cultures:
- land:
  - Europeans: land indiviually owned, passed down in families
	- Native Americans: communal, temporary use of plots
- property and trade:
  - Europeans: business transaction, wealth through high status (capitalism??? or something of the like)
	- Native Americans: communal as well, gift-giving
- gender roles:
  - Europeans: men led househould, farmed, made war; women did household labor, had few rights
	- Native Americans: men hunted, fished, made war; women farmed, had greater freedom and influence (still not equal, though)
- religion:
  - Europeans: believed in christian god, saints in catholicism, exclusive worship
	- Native Americans: believed in a great creator, nature spirits, non-exclusive worship
