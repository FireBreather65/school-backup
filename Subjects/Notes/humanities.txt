~ US History ~

Source Identification:
- primary source is the main source, such as:
  - photography
	- a diary
	- a speech
	- even a shopping list (depending on what you're researching)

- secondary source is your interpretation of what happened

~

Analyzing a Historical Text:
- find out what the people are vs. aren't talking about
^ using the photography analogy, what's outside their view? What's inside their view?

- also find out what the source can tell you (and what it doesn't tell you)

~

Avoiding Common Mistakes in Historical Essays:
- avoid the following sayings:
  - "Throughout history..."
	- "It was inevitable..."
	- "And that's why [insert country] is so great today!"

- instead use:
  - "In the [insert specific time period] in the [insert place(s)]"
	- "The [insert catalyst] caused [insert effect of catalyst]"

~

Native Societies Before Contact:
- three-sister farming = corn, beans, squash

~

Spanish Colonization:
- Encomiendas (a combination of feudalism and slavery)
- it granted land holders the right to labor of Native Americans (WHA??)
- anything they produced through their slave labor gave them Christianization and "protection" of Spanish feudal lords (aka encomenderos)

- the Native population shrunk to 10% of its former size, so they started using enslaved Africans for labor instead

- adopting Christianity outwardly, while keeping their ancestral beliefs inwardly

- the Pueblo Revolt included:
	- killing Spanish priests
	- burning churches (replacing them with kivas)
	- driving the Spanish out	

- racial caste system (ranked individuals by how much Spanish was in their blood, the higher amount, the more legal rights you have)

Highest: Peninsulares (children of two Spaniards born in Spain)
2nd Highest: Criollos (children of two Spaniards born in America)
2nd Lowest: Mestizos (children of a Spaniard + Native American) and Mulatoes (children of a Spaniard + African slave)
Lowest: Indios (children of two Native American parents) and Negroes (children of two African parents)

Comparing European and Native [...] cultures:
- land:
  - Europeans: land indiviually owned, passed down in families
	- Native Americans: communal, temporary use of plots
- property and trade:
  - Europeans: business transaction, wealth through high status (capitalism??? or something of the like)
	- Native Americans: communal as well, gift-giving
- gender roles:
  - Europeans: men led househould, farmed, made war; women did household labor, had few rights
	- Native Americans: men hunted, fished, made war; women farmed, had greater freedom and influence (still not equal, though)
- religion:
  - Europeans: believed in christian god, saints in catholicism, exclusive worship
	- Native Americans: believed in a great creator, nature spirits, non-exclusive worship

~

French and Dutch Colonization:
- much less violent than the Spanish Colonization, more friendly and observant/aware of each others' rituals
^ but it was self-servient, because they traded with each other (the fur trade)

comparing colonization:
- goal:
  - Spain: gold plantations
	- France + Netherlands: trading furs and fish
	- England: plantations + religious freedom
- settlers:
	- Spain: mostly men in large numbers
	- France + Netherlands: mostly men in small numbers
	- England: men in the South, families in the North
- native relations:
  - Spain: violence, slavery, intermarriage
	- France + Netherlands: friendly, intermarriage
	- England: violence, excursion
- religion:
  - Spain: forced conversion to Catholicism
	- France + Netherlands: attempted conversion to Catholicism
	- England: some attempted conversion to Protestantism

~

England in the Age of Exploration:
- they were over 100 years late (1607 vs. 1492)

- but they had their own problems (such as religious conflict between people in their own nation, colonial issues in Ireland <- resulting in a bloody and costly war, and economic depression)

- they figured using privateers and their "awesome" navy to plunder Spanish ships was smarter than starting colonization

~

Motivations for English Colonization:
- once internal religious conflict is resolved (England ends up a Protestant nation), they tried to compete with Catholics

- 'joint-stock company' was the precursor to corporations today (spreads riches and risks regarding stocks)

- "enclosure movement" messed up everything (people who were on the edge of poverty became very poor, because they naturally shared the land with richer people who are now fencing off their property)

- the English government starts thinking there are too many people in England, so they start colonizing the Americas instead

~

Jamestown - [...]:
- De La Warr (pronounced "delaware") comes in and changes the little-to-no conflict of the Powhatans and the English to an all-out war (because he wants to get rid of the Powhatans)

- he raids their villages, burns their crops, and basically erases any semblance of peace between the two nations

- they start cultivating tobacco (once John Rolfe discovers that Virginia is the perfect place to grow it)
^ but of course, they imported African slaves to cultivate it
^ there were also (mainly) indentured servants from England (who, after a few years, became the person they worked for aka a planter)

- so actually, regarding above, in the early 1600s, it was mainly white indentured servants (not until later on was it mainly African slaves), because of expenses (slaves were hundreds of pounds, whereas indentured servants were only a couple of pounds) and because said servants tended to die before they served their entire indenture, as swampy Virginia was not a great place to live due to mosquitoes and accompanying diseases
^ but if they did survive, the headright system ensured that they would get some land

- African slavery became the predominate form of labor around 1700 because of Bacon's Rebellion

- Bacon's Rebellion was a biracial (black and white men) raid force against the Native Americans (because they want their land) and against the House of Burgesses (Virginia government)

- [The above] is related to slavery because they figured that continuing the headright system would lead to constant rebellion, so they decided to find people who would never get freedom or land (they chose African slaves)

~

The West Indies and the Southern Colonies:
- slavery was originally outlawed in Georgia (until peer pressure encouraged them to enact it)

~

Slavery in the British Colonies:
- although all British colonies had ties tp slavery (whether it was financing, growing food for the slaves, or even shipping them), the Southern states had the largest share of enslaved people due to focus on plantation agriculture

- through the course of the 1600s, slavery became stricter and more exclusively defined by race

- slaves were sustained by religion, dance, music, and family

- covert and overt resistance against oppression

~

Society and Religion in the New England Colonies:
- Puritans were/are people who hoped to purify the Church (as they believed it was too "fancy" and not bible-focused enough)
^ there was no separation of church and state, which led to some persecutions of the Puritans, because doubt of the church = doubt of the king

- they (Puritans) went to the NW to set an example of a righteous society for England
^ they instead became an example of righteous society to the rest of NEW England haha

- strict Congregational Church (even though they faced the same thing...hypocrites), if you disagreed you can either go somewhere else or be executed 🤐

~

Politics and Native Relations [...]
- New Englanders' treatment of Native Americans were about the same as Native treatment in Virginia (originally peaceful, but later...not so much, result is the Metacom War)

~

The Middle Colonies:
- they (pacifists and Quakers who lived in Pennsylvania) didn't believe in slavery or war, therefore lived peacfeully and had much ethnic diversity (women could also preach!!!)

~

The Seven Years' War:
- Canada became a British country, not a French country, due to [title]

- Acadians moved to Louisiana and became known as the Cajuns, also due to [title]
^ the British basically kicks them out by taking over their land...

- [title] was a global war (the first one, about 150 years before WWI)
^ it also had many fronts, resulting in a plethora of names for it

- taxation was a result of [title], because England ends up in a lot of debt due to using money to win the war

~

The Declaration of Independence:
- one of the reasons they signed the Declaration of Independence was that they wanted war help (esp. from France, a long time enemy of Great Britain)
^ it worked, and allowed them to win the Revolutionary War

- the Enlightenment was a period in the 1600s and 1700s, when people began to explore scientific observation + reason, instead of blindly accepting religious explanations

- the book "Two Treatises on Government" influenced many thinkers of the time period (during the Enlightenment), and had 2 main points - the idea of natural rights (rights endowed by nature that all people were born with including life, liberty, and property, in contrast to English thinking that there is a "divine right of kings"), and the idea of the Social Contract (the thought that government came from the people, a democracy)
^ he also suggested that a tyrannical government (one that doesn't abide by the Social Contract) can be rebelled against and overthrown

~

The Articles of Confederation:
- it was the first constitution of the US before the one we have now (and have had since 1789)

- essentially allowed the states to be their own soverign islands

- considered a mess because of the above - nothing was consistent or regulated at all between the 13 states

- at first, they were fearful of losing the liberty earned from the war by having a set government - but they found a way to balance both

~

The US Constitution:
- established the three-branch government (legislative, executive, judicial)

- video link: https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/road-to-revolution/creating-a-nation/v/the-us-constitution
^ this is the only one so far, because it's very helpful (especially when learning US Gov + Pol.)

~

Social Consequences:
- the rhetoric of the American Revolution (emphasizing that "all men are created equal") influenced the expansion of voting rights, the gradual abolition of slavery (at least in the South, in the North it was already mostly abolished), and a new role for women through republican motherhood

- regarding republican motherhood, they basically started giving women an education in philosophy and mathematics as well as housekeeping (although it was simply so they could teach their sons more...😒)

- but there were quite a few women who became activists and major reformers in the women's rights and abolitionists movements (yay!)

~

Why was George Washington the 1st?:

The Market Revolution:
- often debated whether [...] or the American Revolution was more revolutionary

- included many revolutions, such as:
	- Industrial Revolution
	- Transportation/Communication Revolution
	- broader Market Revolution

- regarding the Industrial Revolution:
	- new inventions that had come to the US completely revolutionized how things were made (such as the textile mill, the water wheel, the sewing machine, and cotton gin, amongst other things)

	- the US went from being a nation of farmers to being a nation of people who worked for wages per hour (and bought things with those wages)

	- in the beginning, mainly women worked in factories because young men had a good path forward in life (like farming, learning a trade), whereas women didn't really have a place outside of the home, also because they were associated with the fabric/sewing and you could pay them less for the same amount of work (the origin of the gender pay gap???)

	- to add to the above, women dealt with brutal conditions (no air-conditioning, ridiculously low wages, and 12-hour days) partly because again, they had no other opportunities outside of the house, but also because they were able to finally make money by themselves

	- cotton gin (invented by Eli Whitney) revolutionized how much cotton one person could make in a single day (about 50 pounds) <- this also bolstered the institution of slavery in the South, the exact opposite of what we want...


- regarding the Transportation/Communication Revolution:
	- new inventions during the early 19th century also allowed goods and information to be transported faster (such as the railroad, the steamship, canals, and the telegraph, amongst other things)

	- as a result of the above, the scope and pace of business grew (canals and the telegraph affected each consecutively, again, amongst other things)


- regarding the broader Market Revolution:
	- people stopped being their own bosses, instead they report to other bosses

	- the rise of the assembly-line system leads to fewer and fewer artisans making the whole product from start to finish
	^ people also stop taking pride in their own work

	- the US also develops a market economy, meaning people made private deals with investors all over the US and the world

	- after the war of 1812, the US went through about a 20 year period of an unstable boom/bust economy (which included an economic depression in 1819, also called the Panic of 1819)

~

Jacksonian Democracy:
- the [...] was the birth of modern political culture (meaning that lots of practices emerged during this period that are still practiced today, like the two-party system, the spoils system, even political character)

- the first 8 presidents were considered to be a "higher character of man" - they all had a college degree

- they (the presidents) also believed there could be "too much democracy"

- in the beginning, only property-owning men could vote (this including women and free black men, basically as long as you owned land you could vote)

- but then individual states changed it to all white male citizens could vote (removing the loophole of owning property)

- Andrew Jackson was a (kind of) a modern-day Democrat - he believed in the party of the common (white) man (not WOMAN)

- he also rewarded his supporters with government positions, called the spoils system (WHAAAA HOW DO WE STILL HAVE THIS??)

- as Elzaray (@EpicRhyme202) says, "A little hypocritical of Mr. Jackson in my opinion. His whole campaign was surrounded by a 'corrupt bargain' when Adams appointed Clay to Secretary of State, and he starts the spoils system? It sounds like he wasn't very serious about the whole 'corrupt bargain' after all, just a campaign bolster to plea to the human sense of justice."

- he attempted (and succeeded) to kill the Bank of the United States, claiming that the national bank was corrupt and only benefitted the elite

- the Whig party was assembled due to shared hatred of Andrew Jackson (no way...)
^ they later used the same techniques that elected Andrew (man of the people, pulled himself up by the bootstraps, all of those things - although untrue when it comes to William Henry Harrison, he was still advertised that way)

- "...woe betide any candidate who wasn't born in a log cabin..." 🤣

~

Developing an American Identity:
- in the first hundred years of the US, the different regions each developed their own identity barely held together by the Constitution (leading to the Civil War - the southern states against the US government)

- politics (1800-48):
	- major political parties emerge (both)
	- "expansion" of the right to vote (unified)
	- also political controversies (divided)

- economics (1800-48):
	- the Market Revolution (both)
	- controversy over tariffs (divided)
	- separation of economies (divided)
	^ industry (North) vs. agriculture (South)

- foreign policy (1800-48):
	- the War of 1812 (unified)
	- westward expansion (both)
	^ "Manifest Destiny"

~

The Second Great Awakening:
- [...] was a period of religious revival where church membership soared and conversion experiences happened often (heyday from about 1820s to 1840s)

- [...] happened more around the Western part of the US (kind of the newer part that didn't have a well-established church)

- Charles Grandison Finney and Lyman Beecher were two of the biggest preachers of the time period, they didn't really get along (mainly because Finney believed that women could preach in public)

- "circuit riders" were preachers sans a congregation who went by horseback setting up camp meetings where they'd preach instead

- the cult of domesticity showed up more once the US started to urbanize and factories started springing up; it meant that the man of the heteronormative house left and the woman of the heteronormative house stayed in it (because they're morally obligated - huh???)
^ it also gave them a false sense of power (over the home, literally nothing else though...)

- Mormonism is actually from just outside Rochester - not Utah (interesting...)

- the answer to above is that they started to face a lot of persecution, so they moved west to Utah under the leadership of Brigham Young (think BYU)
^ but what about the indigenous people that most likely still lived there??

- the Abolitionist movement came from the period of religious revival (because they started to completely believe that everyone's life is equally valuable)

~

The Development of an American Culture:
- "At the beginning of this period, most of the dominant artisic and cultural productions in the US - the painings, architecture, literature, and even philosophy, were eiher borrowed from or imitations of what was being produced in Europe." <- 😲😲😲

- the Romantic Era believed that individual experience and emotion mattered more, whereas the Enlightenment's stance was facts, reason, and logic

- during the Romantic Era, the first truly American art and culture emerged (when they weren't just trying to copy Europeans)

elements that changed during the Romantic Era:
	- architecture - Americans started to move away from the Georgian style towards the Greek and Roman style 
	^ to symbolize carrying on the traditions of the Roman republic and Greek democracy

	- art - Americans developed a Classical style
	
	- literature, Americans started writing about the unique aspects of their nation's society

~

The Early Temperance Movement:
- Americans believed that they drank way too much alcohol and need to "temper" their consumption

- also can be seen as a part of the Second Great Awakening (creating a more godly and religious society)

- teetotalism is the idea that people shouldn't just temper their alcohol consumption, they should eliminate it completely

~

The Mexican-American War:
- the two major causes of [...] were Texas annexation and "Manifest Destiny"

- Texas annexation was the concept of American slave owners wanting to expand, so they moved to Texas (which was still controlled by Spain)

- after Mexico gained independence, they outlawed slavery (to the resistence of the above settlers)

- after Texas gained independence from Mexico, they requested annexation, but the US believed adding another slave state to the Union was politically dangerous

- until 1845, Texas was an independent nation - what changed is that ardent expansionist (and believer in Manifest Destiny) James K. Polk took office and annexed Texas as soon after taking office as possible

- he also wanted California, but Mexico wasn't selling - so he directed General Zachary Taylor (yes, a future president) to provoke hostilities in the disputed territory (between Mexico and Texas)

- the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war - the US gave $15M to Mexico, and Mexico ceded most of the current Southwest to the US

~

Uncle Tom's Cabin:
- published in 1852, [...] was about the horrors of slavery in the Deep South, and attempted to appeal to Americans' Christian values (by pointing out the contradictions between Christian faith and slavery)

- mixed reactions from the North and South - it was super popular in the North and Europe (resulting in "Tom Shows" for illiterate folks), whereas it was not well-received in the South (resulted in "anti-Tom" novels, such as Aunt Phillis's Cabin, that painted southern slave society in a positive light)

- later on (during the Civil Rights Era), Uncle Tom's Cabin was rejected and "Uncle Tom" became a racial slur (for a black person who deals with stereotypes instead of fighting them)

~

Sectional Conflict:
- economics:
	- North: originally focused on trade and manufacturing (too cold for plantations), moved on to factories once Market Revolution happened, had a growing middle class (the lower classes hoped to expand westward and start a family farm to grow financially stable)
	- South: focused on plantation agriculture (didn't industrialize because cash crops did so well), wealth measured by number of owned slaves, the lower classes hoped to expand westward to own their own plantation and expand cotton

- ideologies:
	- North: most whites didn't object to slavery in the South, but worried about the potential expansion of slavery to the West, "Slave Power" in the government, abolition of the moral evil of slavery
	- South: believed the Consitution protected expansion of slavery, thought that North was trying to take their freedom and rights, George Fitzhugh claimed that slavery was better than capitalism (and poor white people should be enslaved as well as African people)
